### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析框架来研究AI系统在有限时间内无界增长的条件，开发了基于资源构建和部署策略的递归自我改进模型，并提供了可测试的失控增长证书和实际可实施的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量条件下会出现无界能力增长（失控增长），以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可验证的条件替代推测。

Method: 开发了一个分析框架，将能力增长与资源构建和部署策略联系起来，利用物理和信息理论限制定义服务边界，建立内生增长模型耦合资本与计算、数据和能源，并推导出基于可观测序列的决策规则。

Result: 该框架产生了基于改进加速速度相对于当前水平的可证伪测试，提供了可直接实施的安全控制措施（如功率上限、吞吐量限制和评估门控），并通过分析案例研究说明了边界何时约束和何时不约束。

Conclusion: 研究结果用可测试的条件和可部署的控制措施替代了推测，用于认证或排除AI奇点，但存在对所选能力指标和规律性诊断的依赖性限制。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的数据归因方法计算资源消耗大，每次查询都需要大量计算，难以在实际应用中推广。

Method: 将基于遗忘的慢速归因方法蒸馏到特征嵌入空间，结合高效索引和搜索方法，无需运行昂贵的归因算法即可找到高影响力训练图像。

Result: 在MSCOCO训练的中等规模模型和LAION训练的大规模Stable Diffusion模型上验证，性能优于或与现有方法相当，速度提升2,500倍至400,000倍，仅需几秒钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现数据归因方法在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上的大规模应用迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了ColoWorkflow工具，这是首个基于共识的、经过验证的视频评估工具，用于微创结直肠手术的全面工作流程分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线陡峭和并发症影响质量的问题，需要数据驱动的工具来减少变异性、优化培训和改善手术表现。

Method: 通过Delphi流程达成工作流程描述符的共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并应用于多中心视频数据集，评估适用性和评分者间信度。

Result: 达成了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤的共识，工具在54个手术视频中表现出广泛适用性，评分者间信度中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow为视频性能评估建立了可重复框架，支持跨机构基准测试和AI驱动的工作流程识别开发，有望标准化培训、加速能力获取和推进数据驱动的质量改进。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Motivation: 现有基于LRP的剪枝方法虽然无需微调适合数据有限场景，但仍存在显著精度下降问题，限制了实际应用

Method: 使用层相关性传播(LRP)技术进行模型剪枝，在少量数据条件下优化剪枝策略

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了更高的剪枝率同时更好地保持了模型精度

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限场景下具有更好的实用性和性能表现

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

### [7] [PhaseWin Search Framework Enable Efficient Object-Level Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10914)
*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin是一种新颖的相位窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的忠实区域归因，具有近线性复杂度，显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于子模子集选择的归因方法虽然忠实度高，但计算效率低，限制了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次成本贪心选择。

Result: PhaseWin仅使用20%的计算预算就能达到贪心归因95%以上的忠实度，在对象检测和视觉定位任务中始终优于其他归因基线。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测器性能，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在OOD检测中使用负提示时，由于包含过于广泛的非ID特征，可能捕获重叠或误导性信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用LLM初始化类特定的正负提示，优化后正提示关注类内特征，负提示强调类别边界特征，并通过图架构将语义监督传播到视觉分支。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法能有效提升OOD检测性能，通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递实现了更好的检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 研究轻量级YOLO模型在无约束真实环境中的面部表情识别性能，探索检测与分类统一框架下的模型表现，为实时资源受限的情感AI应用提供候选方案。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个基准分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n纳米变体模型，评估指标包括mAP 0.5、精确度、召回率和混淆矩阵。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净的KDEF数据集上获得最高mAP 0.5为95.6，在FER2013数据集上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精度为65.2，假阳性更少。两个模型在FER2013上对视觉相似表情存在更多混淆。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [10] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为异构互补蒸馏（HCD）的新框架，用于解决异构架构（如ViT到ResNet18）知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。该方法通过整合教师和学生的互补特征来在共享logits中对齐表示，并引入子logit解耦蒸馏和正交性损失来确保知识转移的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统同构KD方法难以有效解决这一问题。现有的异构KD方法要么计算成本高、设计复杂，要么过度依赖logit对齐，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: 提出HCD框架：1）通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征；2）与教师倒数第二层特征拼接后通过CFM模块映射到共享logits；3）引入SDD将共享logits划分为n个子logits，与教师logits融合来修正分类；4）使用正交性损失确保子logit多样性，减少冗余知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的KD方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Motivation: 联邦学习中不同医疗机构的扫描仪或协议差异导致特征异质性，现有方法主要关注最终层特征而忽略多级线索，且中间层风格偏差累积降低模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出FedBCS方法：1）频域自适应风格重校准构建原型，解耦内容-风格表示并学习最优风格参数；2）上下文感知双级原型对齐，从编码器和解码器不同层提取领域不变原型并与上下文信息融合。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明该方法具有显著性能表现。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现微表情识别中的运动语义对齐，解决了静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动语义差距的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情绪至关重要，但现有方法面临两个核心挑战：静态外观与动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；现有数据集的文本标签与面部肌肉运动不完全对应，存在语义差距。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，首先构建运动驱动的指令数据集Uni-MER，利用光流和动作单元标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应关系。然后设计三专家架构，将面部动态解耦为结构、动态纹理和运动语义三个独立可解释的表征。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的微表情识别基准测试中展示了最先进的性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面具有特别优势。

Conclusion: 通过将Uni-MER中的指令对齐知识整合到DEFT-LLM中，该方法为微表情注入了有效的物理先验，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，实现了对细微情绪线索的精确捕捉。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构中路由器逻辑与专家内部结构不对齐导致的路由不稳定、专家利用率不足，以及负载不平衡造成的瓶颈问题。

Method: 将每个专家重新参数化到学习的正交特征基中，用输入特征与专家基之间的余弦相似度（特征基分数）替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由。

Result: 在ImageNet分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准测试中达到最先进精度，自然产生更平坦的专家负载分布；3D MRI变体将脑龄预测准确率提高7%以上，并产生解剖学上可解释的专家专业化。

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定问题，在保持稀疏性的同时实现可扩展、可解释的专业化。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: DMC是一个用于CLIP模型类增量学习的两阶段框架，通过解耦视觉编码器和文本软提示的优化来缓解分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT是其增强版本，引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在类增量学习中存在分类器偏差问题，学习新类别的任务特定软提示会导致文本原型过度拟合到最近类别，且现有方法忽视了视觉编码器更新时产生的分布漂移问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架DMC：第一阶段冻结视觉编码器优化文本软提示，第二阶段冻结文本软提示优化视觉编码器。DMC-OT引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息，并采用任务特定提示设计增强任务间可分离性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上的广泛实验表明，DMC和DMC-OT都达到了最先进的性能，DMC-OT进一步将准确率平均提高了1.80%。

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦视觉和文本模态的优化有效缓解了类增量学习中的分类器偏差问题，DMC-OT通过最优传输校准进一步提升了性能，为CLIP模型的持续学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

### [15] [PAS: A Training-Free Stabilizer for Temporal Encoding in Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10979)
*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，通过在多头注意力中应用相反相位偏移并聚合输出，解决视频LLMs中因Rotary Position Embeddings扩展导致的时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会翻转注意力并抑制相关帧。这种不稳定性源于将Rotary Position Embeddings扩展到视频时产生的逆傅里叶时间核，其帧级波纹会扰动本应由原始查询键内积控制的注意力。

Method: 提出PAS方法：在多头注意力中应用小的相反相位偏移，然后聚合它们的输出。这种方法保持每个头的频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并减少相位敏感性，而不改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在匹配的token预算下显示出持续改进，计算开销可忽略不计。分析表明RoPE旋转对数可近似为内容点积乘以时间核，平滑该核可使注意力对小时序变化具有Lipschitz稳定性。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLMs中的鲁棒时间编码提供了一个即插即用的升级方案，通过多相位平均衰减高频波纹，同时保持每个头在奈奎斯特有效采样下的频谱。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

### [16] [Binary Verification for Zero-Shot Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10983)
*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流，用于零样本视觉任务。该方法通过量化和二值化两个步骤，将开放式查询转换为多项选择题，再进一步转化为真/假验证问题，显著提升了零样本视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中表现不佳，特别是处理开放式查询时。作者旨在开发一种无需训练的统一工作流，通过推理时设计来提升模型性能。

Method: 工作流包含两个步骤：(1) 量化：将开放式查询转换为具有明确候选答案的多项选择题；(2) 二值化：为每个候选答案提出真/假问题，通过确定性规则进行决策。

Result: 在指代表达式定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，该方法相比直接回答开放式查询获得了显著提升。量化步骤带来大幅增益，二值化步骤提供了一致的额外提升。

Conclusion: 该工作流提供了一种简单统一的方法，强调推理时设计而非任务特定训练，为当前视觉语言模型提供了实用的零样本视觉能力提升路径。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

*Daxin Li,Yuanchao Bai,Kai Wang,Wenbo Zhao,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新思考自回归模型在无损图像压缩中的应用，通过分层并行性和渐进适应框架，使纯自回归模型成为高性能且实用的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型作为学习型无损图像压缩的理论性能基准，常因计算成本过高而被认为不实用。本文旨在重新确立自回归模型的实际可行性。

Method: 提出HPAC模型，采用分层分解结构和内容感知卷积门控；引入CSI推理优化和AFC高比特深度扩展；使用SARP-FT渐进微调策略进行实例级优化。

Result: 在多种数据集（自然、卫星、医学）上验证了方法的有效性，实现了新的最先进压缩性能，在保持小参数数量和竞争性编码速度的同时显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自回归框架可以在小参数数量和竞争性编码速度下，为学习型无损压缩提供显著增益，确立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

TL;DR: CLUE是一个生成模型框架，能够在无需额外数据的情况下通过固定格式提示实现多样且稳定的图像生成，特别适用于医学等数据有限的专业领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像合成模型在专业领域（如医学）中面临的数据类型有限和数据量不足的问题，同时保持生成的多样性和稳定性。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，使用Style Encoder处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，通过新的第二注意力层和Kullback-Leibler散度在潜在空间中实现图像特征的连续高斯区域表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，CLUE将FID从46.81降低到9.30，召回率从49.60%提升到70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的模型在1000%规模下F1分数达到83.21%（vs. 73.83%），合成数据与真实数据结合时F1分数达到94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过提示注意分层对比学习解决模态缺失问题，提升跨模态表示的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在真实场景中某些模态缺失时性能显著下降，主要原因是完整多模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致。现有方法通过相对简单的生成方法处理缺失模态，但无法充分保持跨模态一致性。

Method: PROMISE创新地将多模态提示学习融入分层对比学习框架，配备专门设计的提示注意机制，动态为缺失特定模态的场景生成鲁棒且一致的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和综合消融研究明确证明，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过提示注意分层对比学习有效弥合完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，显著提升了模态缺失情况下的跨模态表示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid是首个专为创意媒体设计的多模态情感标注视频数据集，包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画表情包，通过情感条件化视频生成技术显著提升了视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽略情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实场景中。

Method: 构建EmoVid数据集，包含情感标签、视觉属性和文本描述；通过系统分析揭示视觉特征与情感感知的时空模式；基于这些洞察微调Wan2.1模型开发情感条件化视频生成技术。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在'视觉处理瓶颈'，容易在长时间生成过程中失去视觉证据的支撑和情境化视觉经验。

Method: 提出VisMem框架，配备动态潜在视觉记忆：短期模块用于细粒度感知保留，长期模块用于抽象语义整合，在推理过程中无缝调用这些记忆。

Result: 在理解、推理和生成等多样化视觉基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一种新的潜在空间记忆增强范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

TL;DR: SP-Guard是一种改进扩散模型安全性的方法，通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，只针对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，在提升安全性的同时最小化对内容的意外修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法只针对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，导致安全性不足或过度修改内容。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，只对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，实现了自适应和选择性的安全控制。

Result: 实验表明SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最小化了对内容的意外修改。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了图像生成的安全性，还强调了图像生成过程中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳跃连接编码器-解码器架构（U-Net变体）在逆问题中仍存在信息丢失问题，限制了高频细节的恢复能力。

Method: SUPER方法利用小波的完美重建特性防止信息退化，同时选择性抑制冗余特征，作为即插即用的解码器模块，无需严格的框架约束，可应用于各种U-Net变体。

Result: 在多个裂缝检测基准测试中，SUPER显著提升了细裂缝（宽度小于4像素）的分割性能，在智能手机图像去噪任务中也实现了PSNR的适度提升，验证了其在低频和高频场景下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SUPER作为一种即插即用的解码器模块，在统一的、重建感知的框架内实现了高频保真度和全局一致性，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Method: 构建包含模拟器和真实世界数据的综合基准，通过模型、规则和人工方法生成大规模问题，涵盖场景理解、对象理解、感知评估和协作决策四个维度。

Result: 评估40个MLLM显示在协作感知任务中存在显著性能差距，最佳模型平均落后人类24.38%，且在不同任务间表现不一致。微调实验证实了模拟到真实迁移的可行性。

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估的空白，揭示了MLLM在复杂协作场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法未能利用胚胎发育的分布先验，且依赖单焦点信息导致在细胞遮挡下特征模糊，需要更鲁棒的表示方法。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散框架：1) 训练冻结的帧级编码器提取多焦点特征；2) 多焦点特征融合策略构建3D感知形态表示，结合混合语义边界条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上达到最先进结果，单次去噪步骤即可获得82.8%和81.3%的平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦点融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类精度。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存(HGC)方法，通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来降低可控生成模型的计算开销，显著提高生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时计算需求大、生成效率低的问题。

Method: 采用两种缓存策略：(1)基于特征重用的粗粒度缓存(块级)，在模型推理的每一步动态绕过编码器-解码器块中的冗余计算；(2)细粒度缓存(提示级)，在模块内重用连续推理步骤中的交叉注意力图，并将其扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算中。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在平衡生成效率和视觉质量方面具有优势。在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本(MACs)显著降低63%(从18.22T到6.70T)，同时语义保真度损失保持在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法能够显著提高可控生成模型的效率，同时保持生成质量，为高效的可控内容生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%分类准确率和0.75分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。多模态LLM在组合泛化方面表现独特优势。

Conclusion: CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力提供了严格的测试平台，证明了MAT框架的广泛实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Conclusion: 通过多参考图像和特征校准，生成式图像合成模型能够更好地同时保持细节和调整前景姿态/视角。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

*Dor Shmilovich,Tony Wu,Aviad Dahan,Yuval Domb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteAttention是一种利用扩散注意力中时间相干性的方法，通过在去噪序列中实现演化计算跳跃来显著降低注意力计算复杂度，在保持视频生成质量的同时实现大幅加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器视频生成方法虽然质量出色，但面临二次注意力复杂度导致的过高延迟问题。现有加速方法存在基本权衡：动态估计稀疏注意力模式计算开销大且易出错，静态稀疏模式固定且在去噪过程中往往不是最优的。

Method: 发现扩散注意力具有时间相干性结构特性，即在去噪步骤间稀疏模式保持稳定。LiteAttention利用这一特性，早期标记非必要图块并将跳过决策向前传播，从而无需重复分析开销即可消除冗余注意力计算。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生产级视频扩散模型上展示了显著加速效果，且没有质量下降。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的适应性和静态方法的效率，为扩散变换器视频生成提供了一种有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Conclusion: HinD框架成功解决了KBVQA中推理过程隐式的问题，通过激发MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，在无需外部资源的情况下实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Conclusion: OT-ALD有效消除了潜在分布不匹配问题，在翻译效率和图像质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios.

*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用于可解释的多类型异常检测，能够区分不同类型的异常，无需为每个对象类别训练单独模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释异常检测方法无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练和维护单独模型，这在实际应用中成本高昂。同时，现有大型视觉语言模型计算密集，不适合实时或嵌入式系统。

Method: 提出MultiTypeFCDD框架，使用仅图像级标签学习并生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型。作为统一框架，能够跨多个对象类别区分异常类型。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上评估，结果与最先进复杂模型相当，但参数负载和推理时间显著降低。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD是一个高度实用的解决方案，特别适用于计算资源受限的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，影响4D高斯泼溅等动态场景重建方法的效果。

Method: 采用粗到精的对齐模块，先确定帧级粗偏移，再细化为亚帧精度，可作为即插即用模块集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序未对齐视频，显著提升基线方法的重建质量。

Conclusion: 提出的时序对齐策略增强了4DGS框架对异步数据的鲁棒性，为未同步多视角视频的高质量重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Viper-F1实现了准确、细粒度的理解，同时显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间模型和视觉基础增强，在保持高效推理的同时解决了多模态模型在细粒度理解上的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小规模输入变化下的可靠性尚未得到充分理解，需要系统评估模型对良性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 配备模块化组件的基础模型不受初始训练范围限制，可以发展为医学影像的多任务、多模态系统。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在稀疏训练视图下容易过拟合，主要原因是缺乏中间视图的监督。受视频扩散模型(VDM)成功的启发，希望利用其丰富的多视图一致性先验来改善3DGS的性能。

Conclusion: GSD框架成功利用VDM的多视图一致性先验来增强3DGS在稀疏视图下的表示能力，通过深度和语义指导确保VDM的分数更新方向与正确的相机姿态和几何结构对齐。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 位置偏见已被证明对各种任务中的模型性能产生负面影响。虽然最近的研究广泛探讨了文本生成模型中的位置偏见，但在表示模型中的存在和影响仍未充分探索，特别是在多模态模型中。

Method: 首先区分上下文重要性和位置偏见，然后评估不同模型和数据集中的位置偏见存在程度和范围。

Result: 实验表明位置偏见在多模态模型中普遍存在，但在不同模态中表现不同：文本编码器倾向于输入开头，图像编码器在开头和结尾都表现出偏见。这种偏见源于或由位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及多模态训练中使用图像-文本对的性质等因素共同作用产生或放大。

Conclusion: 多模态表示模型中存在显著的位置偏见，且在不同模态中表现模式不同，这种偏见由多种因素共同导致。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi是一个混合专家框架，通过联合建模领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支，解决多源点云数据异构性导致的负迁移问题，在多个3D理解基准上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D深度学习在多领域泛化能力有限，主要由于数据集规模小和多源点云高度异构性。不同传感器采集的点云在密度和噪声分布上存在显著差异，导致多领域融合时出现负迁移。现有方法要么只关注领域感知特征，要么只关注领域通用特征，忽略了二者的协同潜力。

Method: 提出DoReMi混合专家框架，包含领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支。通过领域引导空间路由动态激活专家分支，使用熵控制动态分配实现稳定高效的专家利用。统一表示分支通过鲁棒多属性自监督学习预训练并保持冻结，保留跨领域几何和结构先验。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准上评估，DoReMi在ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，在S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，相比现有方法表现出竞争性或更优性能。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应建模多样化领域分布，同时保持全局一致性。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的小样本风格编辑框架，通过构建包含五种不同风格的基准数据集，采用参数高效的混合专家低秩自适应（MoE LoRA）方法，结合风格特定和风格共享路由机制，在扩散变换器（DiT）模型中实现多风格联合微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在显著减少LoRA参数的情况下，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决小样本风格编辑问题，通过参数高效的MoE LoRA机制实现多风格联合学习，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

TL;DR: GEODE模型通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，解决了现有视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈问题，使用1.5B参数实现了与7B+模型相媲美的空间推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在理解真实世界3D空间智能方面存在根本性困难，主要源于输入阶段的几何感知编码器与2D特征冲突，以及输出阶段的离散分词器无法生成精确连续数值的双重瓶颈。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块（DRM）作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据与2D视觉特征；直接回归头（DRH）采用"嵌入即值"范式，通过轻量级MLP精确回归标量和3D边界框。

Result: 1.5B参数的模型作为高级语义分发器，实现了最先进的空间推理性能，可与7B+模型相媲美。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双模块架构，有效解决了视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的核心瓶颈，为空间智能提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

TL;DR: CountSteer是一种无需训练的方法，通过引导扩散模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态来改进文本到图像生成中的对象计数准确性，提高约4%的计数精度而不影响视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但往往无法准确遵循文本中的数值指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现模型内部对自身计数准确性有隐含认知，可以利用这种潜在认知来更精确地指导生成。

Method: 基于模型内部对数值正确性的潜在编码，提出了CountSteer方法，在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，CountSteer将对象计数准确性提高了约4%，同时保持了视觉质量。

Conclusion: CountSteer是朝着更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成迈出的简单而有效的步骤，展示了利用模型内部信号改进生成质量的可能性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

### [60] [Discovering Meaningful Units with Visually Grounded Semantics from Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11262)
*Melika Behjati,James Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过分组caption tokens来获取细粒度视觉语言表示的新方法，该方法将语言表示与图像中对象级别的信息对齐，从而提升模型对视觉和语言的细粒度理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要关注图像块与语言token的对齐，但图像块对人类视觉没有意义，单个token也不一定携带可接地的图像信息。需要将token分组来描述场景的不同方面，以获得更细粒度的知识理解。

Method: 提出了一种模型架构，在模型中自动对caption tokens进行分组，以捕获语言的细粒度表示。将这些表示与经过训练发现对象的图像编码器输出进行对齐，使表示达到图像中对象级别的粒度。

Result: 通过学习token分组，视觉语言模型在视觉和语言的细粒度理解方面表现更好。模型发现的token组在定性和定量上都与文本中的可接地短语高度相似。

Conclusion: 通过token分组的方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，所发现的token组与真实语言中的语义单元具有良好对应关系。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 即使测试时不需要场景图输入，模型也能通过场景图条件化训练更好地内化和基于关系先验知识，显著改善自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Conclusion: 通过控制合成数据生成过程可以解决微调中的偏差和分布不平衡问题，在合成数据上微调的模型能更好地迁移到真实世界数据，且性能优于传统微调方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Conclusion: 通过学习切片间关系，CORAL产生了具有解剖信息的表示，有利于下游分割任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

TL;DR: DocSLM是一种高效的小型视觉语言模型，专为资源受限的边缘设备上的长文档理解而设计，通过分层多模态压缩器和流式弃权机制，在减少82%视觉标记、75%参数和71%延迟的同时，达到或超越最先进方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在长复杂文档上表现出强大的多模态推理能力，但其高内存占用使其难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: DocSLM采用分层多模态压缩器联合编码每页的视觉、文本和布局信息为固定长度序列，并引入流式弃权机制，通过基于熵的不确定性校准器顺序处理文档片段并过滤低置信度响应。

Result: 在多个长多模态文档基准测试中，DocSLM在使用82%更少视觉标记、75%更少参数和71%更低延迟的情况下，达到或超越了最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: DocSLM能够在轻量级边缘设备上提供可靠的多模态文档理解，解决了大型模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices. Code is available in the supplementary material.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD是一个用于6DoF物体姿态估计的标准分辨率事件相机合成数据集，包含50,000个事件序列，采用PBR渲染和BOP方法生成，通过系统评估确定了时间表面线性衰减和双通道极性编码的最佳事件表示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件视觉领域缺乏与帧基计算机视觉相当的综合性合成数据资源的问题，为6DoF物体姿态估计提供高质量的事件相机数据。

Method: 使用基于物理渲染(PBR)场景和BOP方法合成事件序列，采用模拟线性相机运动确保完整场景覆盖，系统评估不同事件表示方法对CNN推理的影响。

Result: 时间表面线性衰减和双通道极性编码在姿态估计性能上表现最优，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案，极性信息对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个综合性事件相机合成数据集，确定了最佳事件表示方法，为事件视觉研究提供了标准化基准和可复现的实验平台。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.
  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D是一个无需3D运动标注的3D人体运动生成框架，通过2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并采用无3D监督的正则化目标来增强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这源于精确3D监督导致模型过度拟合固定坐标模式而非学习3D结构和运动语义。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并采用视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性等3D无监督正则化目标。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练，Free3D能够生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能达到甚至超过完全3D监督的模型。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能够促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于低秩稀疏原理的情感理解框架LSEF，通过分层建模情感基础（长期情感基调）和瞬时波动（短期情感变化），解决了视频情感计算中的模型不稳定和表示退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临复杂情感动态导致的模型不稳定和表示退化问题。由于不同情感波动在不同情感上下文中的含义不同，核心限制在于缺乏分层结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分。

Method: 提出低秩稀疏情感理解框架LSEF，包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块捕获低秩情感基础，动态解耦模块分离稀疏瞬时信号，一致性集成模块重建多尺度稳定性和反应性一致性。采用秩感知优化策略自适应平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态辨别能力，进一步验证了分层低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态方面的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 分层低秩稀疏建模为理解情感动态提供了有效的理论框架，LSEF在视频情感计算中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Motivation: 解决生物医学成像中多模态大语言模型科学推理能力受限的问题，主要由于缺乏大规模高质量的训练数据。

Method: 三阶段构建方法：1) 从专家验证的图-标题对中引导监督；2) 使用HiCQA-Graph异构图融合NLI、CLIP和智能体信号过滤不一致样本；3) 用MLLM生成多选题并人工筛选。

Conclusion: 精心构建的数据集能够使较小规模的MLLM在显微镜推理任务上达到与大型模型竞争的性能，证明了高质量数据的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要建立系统评估框架来填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度质量评分、中粒度失真类型识别、细粒度失真强度分类，并使用思维链提示来增强模型性能。

Result: 评估显示多模态大语言模型具备初步的文档图像质量评估能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和强度误判等关键限制。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个用于类增量学习的新框架，通过在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行适配，无需额外参数，利用正交低秩融合防止遗忘，并结合跨模态混合原型提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP应用于类增量学习面临两个主要挑战：适配下游任务需要额外可学习模块增加模型复杂度和遗忘风险；现有方法未能充分利用多模态表示的优势有效整合视觉和文本模态。

Method: 提出BOFA框架，将所有模型适配限制在CLIP现有的跨模态桥接层，采用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新约束到与过去任务特征正交的低秩安全子空间，使用跨模态混合原型结合稳定的文本原型和视觉对应物。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，BOFA相比现有方法实现了更优越的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA通过桥接层正交融合适配，在无需数据重放的情况下实现了稳定的知识积累，显著提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

TL;DR: WEAVE是首个用于上下文交错跨模态理解和生成的套件，包含WEAVE-100k大规模数据集和WEAVEBench人工标注基准，旨在解决现有方法在多轮、上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的局限性。


<details>

Conclusion: WEAVE为研究上下文交错理解和生成提供了视角和基础，揭示了当前方法在多轮上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的持续局限性和挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架来区分文本到图像扩散模型中的识别与实现能力，重点关注多模态标志性现象，即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊界限，特别关注文化共享关联的多模态标志性现象，如标题唤起熟悉艺术品或电影场景的情况。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别（模型是否识别引用）与实现（如何通过复制或重新诠释来描绘），通过量化两个维度的指标进行评估。评估了5个扩散模型在767个维基数据来源的文化引用上，涵盖静态和动态图像。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换。提示扰动实验显示即使文本线索改变，模型仍经常复制标志性视觉结构。文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、引用流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于复制内容，更在于如何转换和重新语境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，实现更丰富的语境理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个受大脑启发的条件扩散框架，通过显式建模皮层层次结构来解码fMRI信号，将视觉区域分为早期/中期/晚期流，构建与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔，实现高效且可解释的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的解码器直接使用fMRI特征而不分析视觉信息在皮层中的组织方式，忽视了大脑的层次处理结构，模糊了不同视觉区域的功能角色。

Method: 提出Hi-DREAM框架：1）ROI适配器将fMRI分组为早期/中期/晚期流，转换为多尺度皮层金字塔；2）轻量级深度匹配ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示；3）浅层尺度保留布局和边缘，深层尺度强调物体和语义。

Result: 在自然场景数据集上的实验显示，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 基于皮层层次结构的条件结构化是纯数据驱动嵌入的强大替代方案，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

TL;DR: VP-Bench是一个评估多模态大语言模型视觉提示理解能力的基准，包含感知和下游任务两个阶段，测试了28个模型在8种形状和355种属性组合下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs缺乏对视觉提示（如边界框）理解能力的系统性评估，而这是人类直观的交互方式，需要明确当前模型是否能有效识别和使用视觉提示。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段测试模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示；第二阶段评估视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLMs（包括GPT-4o、InternVL3、Qwen2.5-VL等），分析了影响视觉提示理解的因素，如属性变化、问题安排和模型规模。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLMs如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的指称问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Prelim Attention Score (PAS)方法，通过分析LVLM对先前生成标记的注意力来检测物体幻觉，无需额外训练即可实时过滤幻觉预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，研究发现模型在幻觉预测中往往忽略图像而依赖先前生成的标记来推断新物体。

Method: 提出Prelim Attention Score (PAS)，基于对prelim标记的注意力权重计算，无需额外前向传播，可在推理过程中实时计算。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的物体幻觉检测性能，支持实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: PAS是一种轻量级、免训练的信号，通过利用先前被忽视的注意力模式，能有效检测和缓解LVLM的物体幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

### [83] [Rethinking Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Remote Sensing Modality-Missing Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11460)
*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL)框架，将模态缺失重新定义为多任务学习问题，通过双路由机制实现参数高效的自适应，在遥感多模态分类中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感多模态分类中因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致的模态缺失问题，现有两阶段适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时具有完整多模态数据，限制了在真实世界不完整性下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出MaMOL框架，引入双路由机制：任务导向的动态路由器自适应激活不同缺失模式的专家，模态特定共享的静态路由器保持稳定的跨模态知识共享；通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效适应。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，在不同缺失率下均取得良好性能，计算开销最小；在自然图像数据集上的迁移实验验证了其可扩展性和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL为不完整多模态学习提供了一个通用且高效的解决方案，具有参数高效、计算开销小、跨领域适用等优势。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Roman Kinakh,Gonzalo R. Ríos-Muñoz,Arrate Muñoz-Barrutia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B是一个贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样直接从H&E染色组织图像推断PD-L1表达，提供准确分割和认知不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建，在循环训练期间采样多样模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差实现不确定性估计。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数0.805，平均IoU 0.709，性能与现有基线相当，同时提供像素级不确定性图谱。

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是迈向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估的有前景的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

### [85] [Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526)
*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的视觉语言模型融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向交叉注意力层来对齐视觉和文本隐藏状态，在保持编码器效率的同时提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含丰富的模态特定结构，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的多模态匹配方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部附近放置少量仅交叉的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间，进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新回传，使用简单稳定器改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比较的视觉语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种高效的多模态融合方法，通过轻量级交叉注意力模块有效对齐视觉和文本表示，在保持编码器独立性的同时显著提升多模态理解性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过离线数据增强和并行检索的结构化情景记忆系统，解决了历史人物对话系统中深度与效率的权衡问题，在保持低延迟的同时实现深度对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在历史人物对话系统中面临关键权衡：简单检索增强生成产生浅层响应，而多阶段反思虽然深度足够但延迟过高。

Method: 将传记数据转化为1774个丰富的第一人称记忆，带有情感语义元数据，采用两阶段检索实现0.52秒的提示生成，利用离线数据增强和高效并行检索。

Result: 评估显示该方法在GPT-4上与传统RAG相当，在较小模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-3）上显著优于传统RAG，特别适合资源受限部署。

Conclusion: 该架构不仅作为对话接口，还作为传记分析的研究工具，提供时空热图、情感轨迹分析和交互路径跟踪等可视化功能，适用于教育、博物馆和研究应用。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

TL;DR: HyQuT是首个用于自然语言生成的混合量子-经典大语言模型，在8M和150M参数规模上将变分量子电路集成到Transformer框架中，实验表明仅需10个量子比特和80个量子门即可替换约10%的经典参数，并保持相当的收敛稳定性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子计算已逐渐应用于替代经典计算，但现有量子或混合模型仍局限于简单任务，尚未成功应用于大规模自然语言生成。本研究旨在探索将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型中的可行性。

Method: 提出HyQuT架构，将变分量子电路(VQCs)集成到Transformer框架中，在8M和150M参数规模上进行实验，使用10个量子比特和80个量子门来替换部分经典参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，在150M参数模型中，仅需10个量子比特和80个量子门即可替换约10%的经典参数，同时实现了可比较的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究为将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型中提供了早期可行性证明，展示了量子组件在复杂语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

### [88] [Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在处理时间约束方面存在系统性风险，包括双峰性能分布、极端提示脆弱性和系统性行动偏见，表明当前自回归架构缺乏处理时间约束的必要机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM在需要实时决策的智能体架构中是否能够可靠地判断行动窗口是否开放或已关闭，这一假设尚未经过验证。

Method: 使用截止时间检测任务对8个生产级模型（2.8-8B参数）进行时间约束处理特征分析，并通过200个合成示例进行微调实验。

Result: 发现系统性部署风险：双峰性能分布（模型准确率要么95%要么50%）、极端提示脆弱性（仅格式变化就导致30-60个百分点波动）和系统性行动偏见（失败模型100%假阳性率）。参数数量与此能力无相关性。

Conclusion: 时间约束满足能力无法通过自然语言的下一个词预测可靠学习，需要具备连续时间状态表示、显式约束检查和系统性组合推理的架构机制，当前自回归架构缺乏这些机制。

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Spectral NSR框架，通过引入三种语义增强方法：基于transformer的节点合并、句子级蕴涵验证和外部知识图谱对齐，在不改变核心谱推理引擎的情况下提升图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Spectral NSR框架在推理过程中存在冗余节点、低质量边和缺失上下文等问题，需要在不依赖二次注意力机制的情况下提升推理的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 1) 使用Sentence-BERT、SimCSE等上下文嵌入进行基于transformer的节点合并以减少冗余；2) 使用RoBERTa、DeBERTa等预训练NLI分类器进行句子级蕴涵验证以改善边质量；3) 与ConceptNet、Wikidata等外部知识图谱对齐以补充缺失上下文。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试中，准确率提升最高达3.8%，对对抗性案例的泛化能力增强，推理噪声减少。

Conclusion: 通过在谱推理阶段之前进行语义和符号化精炼，实现了高效、可解释且可扩展的推理系统，适用于开放领域和真实世界部署。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PRO框架，通过轻量级偏好适配器自动推断特定提示的偏好权重，解决了多目标对齐中手动指定偏好权重的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多目标对齐方法依赖手动指定偏好权重，这给用户带来负担且导致训练效率低下，因为需要探索不相关的偏好组合。

Method: 提出PRO框架，使用轻量级偏好适配器在训练和部署阶段自动学习每个提示的适当偏好权重，通过在多奖励模型偏好的响应上训练归一化奖励分数来实现。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法在多目标对齐场景中优于固定偏好权重方法，多个任务的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PRO框架能够自动推断提示特定的偏好权重，有效解决了多目标对齐中的偏好权重指定问题，提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利领域产生的特定失败模式：产生过度均匀的嵌入，失去语义连贯性。希望通过专利文档内部不同章节的自然多样性来改善这一问题。

Method: 提出基于章节的增强方法，将专利的不同部分（如摘要、权利要求、背景技术）作为互补视图。这种设计引入了自然的语义和结构多样性，缓解了过度分散问题。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，这种完全自监督的方法在现有技术检索和分类任务上匹配或超越了基于引用和IPC监督的基线方法，同时避免了依赖脆弱或不完整的标注。

Conclusion: 不同专利章节专门适用于不同任务——权利要求和摘要有利于检索，而背景技术部分有助于分类。这凸显了利用专利固有语篇结构进行表示学习的价值，以及利用文档内视图进行可扩展和通用专利理解的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一任务、有限模型和英文报告，缺乏对多任务、多模型、多语言和多机构环境下LLM在临床记录中提取结构化信息的系统性评估。

Method: 在荷兰、英国和捷克三个机构的病理学和放射学报告中，评估15个开源LLM在6种疾病用例中的表现，比较6种提示策略（零样本、单样本、少样本、思维链、自一致性和提示图），使用任务适当指标和线性混合效应模型量化方差。

Result: 排名靠前的模型在各任务中达到接近评分者间一致性的宏观平均分数，中小型通用模型表现与大型模型相当，提示图和少样本提示使性能提升约13%，任务特定因素比模型大小或提示策略对结果影响更大。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够跨疾病、语言和机构从临床报告中提取结构化数据，为临床数据管理提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于加权专家乘积（wPoE）的测试时引导框架，将通用压缩模型与预训练神经语言模型自适应结合，确保压缩率至少与最佳单个模型相当，无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通用压缩器计算开销低、速度快、适用范围广，但压缩率不如现代神经压缩器；神经压缩器虽然能更好建模数据分布，但泛化能力不足，难以处理未见数据。

Method: 采用测试时引导的加权专家乘积（wPoE）框架，在推理时自适应地结合通用压缩模型和预训练神经语言模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能，且能与任何自回归语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该框架为增强跨不同数据分布的文本压缩提供了实用解决方案，确保压缩率不低于最佳单个模型。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法往往忽视统计不确定性量化，而二元评估指标在评估模型有害输出倾向或对抗性输入敏感性时存在不确定性，需要更严谨的统计方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来量化二元评估指标中的不确定性，特别关注概率文本生成策略引起的不确定性，并通过两个案例研究验证该方法。

Result: 该方法能够为基于LLM的系统行为提供有用的不确定性量化，在评估拒绝率和成对偏好等场景中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法能够有效量化大语言模型评估中的统计不确定性，为模型行为评估提供更可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

TL;DR: 本文对7种前沿大语言模型在粤语、日语和土耳其语上的表现进行了全面评估，发现虽然大型专有模型表现最佳，但在文化细微理解和形态学泛化方面仍存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言（如英语）上取得了显著成果，但在低资源和形态丰富的语言中的有效性仍未充分探索。

Method: 创建了一个跨语言基准测试，涵盖粤语、日语和土耳其语，包括四个任务：开放域问答、文档摘要、英译X和文化对话。结合人工评估和自动指标评估模型性能。

Result: 最大的专有模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4、Claude 3.5）在语言和任务上普遍领先，但在文化细微理解和形态学泛化方面存在显著差距。较小的开源模型在流畅性和准确性上大幅落后。

Conclusion: 所有模型都在一定程度上难以应对每种语言的独特语言挑战，如土耳其语的粘着形态和粤语的口语表达。需要开发更具文化意识和语言泛化能力的大语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督框架，通过使用偏斜感知聚合策略来增强保护模型的语义鲁棒性，减少语义变异性约58%，提高基准准确率约2.5%，并改善模型校准达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型对表面语言变化敏感，即使意义保持不变的改写也会导致安全评分大幅波动，这表明缺乏语义基础，需要提高语义鲁棒性。

Method: 引入自监督框架，利用改写集通过新颖的偏斜感知聚合策略来强制执行预测一致性，以计算鲁棒目标。

Result: 方法在六个开源保护模型上测试，语义变异性减少约58%，基准准确率平均提高约2.5%，并能泛化到未见过的风格变化，同时模型校准改善达40%。

Conclusion: 将语义一致性作为首要训练目标具有重要价值，为构建更可靠保护模型提供了可扩展方案，揭示了模型校准与一致性之间的双向关系。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了STaDS框架，通过结构化表格决策模拟来评估LLMs的真实理解能力，发现大多数模型在不同领域难以保持一致的准确性，且存在预测准确性与决策因素依赖之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然预测准确率高，但准确性并不等同于真正的理解能力。需要评估模型是否能在多个实例和不同领域中做出一致、有依据的决策，并依赖相关和领域基础的决策因素。

Method: 引入结构化表格决策模拟(STaDS)，将LLMs视为专业人士进行结构化决策"考试"。通过(i)问题和指令理解、(ii)基于知识的预测、(iii)依赖相关决策因素三个方面联合评估理解能力。

Result: 对9个前沿LLMs在15个不同决策设置中的分析显示：(a)大多数模型在不同领域难以实现一致的强准确性；(b)模型可能准确但全局不忠实，存在陈述理由与预测驱动因素之间的频繁不匹配。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要全局层面的理解评估协议，并倡导超越准确性的新框架来增强LLMs的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了传统机器学习与深度迁移学习在预测人工耳蜗植入儿童语言发展方面的表现，发现基于双线性注意力融合策略的深度迁移学习模型在准确率、敏感性和特异性方面均优于传统机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工耳蜗植入能显著改善重度感音神经性听力损失儿童的语言能力，但个体间效果差异很大，且无法通过植入年龄或残余听力可靠预测。本研究旨在探索更准确的预测方法。

Method: 研究纳入278名双侧感音神经性听力损失儿童，使用基于大脑神经解剖特征的传统机器学习和深度迁移学习算法，构建高/低语言改善者的二元分类预测模型。

Result: 深度迁移学习预测模型表现优异：准确率92.39%，敏感性91.22%，特异性93.56%，AUC为0.977，在所有结果指标上均优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 深度迁移学习通过直接捕捉判别性和任务特定信息，显著提高了预测性能，支持开发适用于全球人工耳蜗项目的单一预测模型的可行性。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Motivation: 代码切换语音翻译面临语义建模复杂和CS数据稀缺两大挑战，现有方法依赖模型隐式学习语义且需要昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 采用MoE语音投影器，每个专家专攻特定语言的语义子空间；引入多阶段训练范式，利用单语ASR和ST数据；使用语言特定损失和组内负载均衡损失指导专家分配；采用过渡损失解决数据差距问题。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上进行的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效解决代码切换语音翻译中的关键挑战，通过MoE架构和多阶段训练策略显著提升了翻译性能。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出GVF微调方法，通过事实锚数据增强、事实感知指令调优和事实一致性损失函数三个核心机制，系统性地提升多模态大语言模型的视觉事实一致性，显著减少视觉幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题严重损害了其可靠性，现有的微调方法改进有限，无法深入干预事实推理过程。

Method: GVF微调方法整合三个核心机制：事实锚数据增强（使用结构化事实锚和反事实提示丰富训练数据）、事实感知指令调优（将事实线索嵌入显式指令）、事实一致性损失函数（专门惩罚事实不准确性）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B模型上评估，GVF微调在VHTest基准测试中显著优于标准微调，在开放式问题和是/否问题格式上都表现更好，同时在MME和POPE等多模态基准上保持或略有提升性能。

Conclusion: GVF方法有效缓解了视觉幻觉问题，且不损害一般的理解和推理能力，为提升多模态模型的事实一致性提供了系统性的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的演示选择方法主要关注测试输入与演示之间的语义相似性，往往忽视了标签分布对齐的重要性，这限制了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的性能表现。

Method: 提出两阶段演示选择方法：首先基于语义相似性选择TopK候选演示，然后使用微调的BERT类小语言模型生成标签分布并计算标签分布散度，选择与测试输入标签分布对齐的演示。

Result: 在七个文本分类基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于先前的演示选择策略。进一步分析显示，大型语言模型的性能与用于标签分布估计的小语言模型的准确性呈正相关。

Conclusion: 结合语义相似性和标签分布对齐的演示选择方法能有效提升上下文学习性能，且底层小语言模型的标签分布估计准确性对最终结果有重要影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

<details>

Motivation: 气候变化和温室气体排放主要由消费品的生产、使用和处置贡献，因此需要工具来评估消费品对环境的影响，其中生命周期评估（LCA）是重要组成部分。

Method: 开发SpiderGen工作流，将传统LCA的分类和方法论与LLM的推理能力和世界知识相结合，生成用于LCA的程序信息，并使用真实LCA文档作为基准进行评估。

Result: SpiderGen提供了准确的LCA过程信息，F1分数达到62%，成本低于1美元且处理时间少于10分钟，相比传统LCA（成本超过25000美元，耗时21人天）显著降低了人力和成本。

Conclusion: SpiderGen在减少碳影响评估的人力和成本方面具有潜力，能够以低成本快速生成LCA过程信息，优于几种基线技术。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在广泛应用中的采用，用户与模型的交互频率和规模不断增长，需要评估模型在真实世界任务中的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用简单的多轮后续提示评估模型答案变化，通过马尔可夫链分析多轮对话中的模型准确率动态，并检验线性探针是否能预测这些变化。

Result: 发现LLM存在显著脆弱性："再想想"提示使Gemini 1.5 Flash在九轮对话中准确率下降约10%；结合语义等价重述问题使Claude 3.5 Haiku准确率下降7.5%；模型准确率可通过马尔可夫链有效建模，预测长期平稳准确率平均比首轮低约8%。

Conclusion: 研究确立了平稳准确率作为交互场景下的原则性鲁棒性度量，揭示了模型在重复提问下的脆弱性，解决这种不稳定性对于在高风险交互场景中部署LLM至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

Motivation: 探索递归生成中偏见放大的风险，需要理解偏见动态并开发有效的缓解策略。

Method: 使用三种评估框架（规则匹配、语义相似度、下游任务性能），在三种初始偏见水平和四种缓解策略下进行实验。

Result: 低初始偏见会放大（+36%），高初始偏见会衰减（-26%）；对比增强方法在下游任务中显著减少偏见（平均91%）。

Conclusion: 语义相似度指标与行为公平结果可能背离，需要多维评估来确保合成数据生成的负责任性。

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Result: 评估了50多个LLM，观察到同一模型谱系中明显的代际性能跃迁，发现某些模型采用投机性捷径获胜，表明静态基准测试可能存在更高级别的评估范式污染。

Conclusion: 动态评估可以作为静态评估的补充，Squid Game框架为建立更可信的LLM评估提供了新途径。

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

TL;DR: 研究表明AI语音系统能够隐式学习人类社交规范，在礼貌提示下会降低语速，与人类表达礼貌的方式一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI语音系统是否能够学习人类社交中非显性的礼貌表达方式，特别是通过降低语速来传达礼貌这一微妙特征。

Method: 使用两个领先AI平台（AI Studio和OpenAI）的22个合成语音，在"礼貌正式"和"随意非正式"条件下朗读固定脚本，测量语音时长。

Result: 两个AI平台的礼貌提示都产生了比随意提示更慢的语速，效应量很大，AI Studio所有语音和OpenAI大多数语音都显示出统计显著性。

Conclusion: AI能够隐式学习和复制人类沟通的心理细微差别，突显其作为能够强化人类社交规范的社会行为者的新兴角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Motivation: 研究动机是系统评估LLMs在国际关系领域的国家层面偏见，特别是针对联合国安理会五个常任理事国，以了解模型偏见的多维特性及其对IR应用的影响。

Method: 基于联合国安理会历史记录开发包含三个测试的偏见评估框架，评估不同LLMs的国家层面偏见，并提出结合RAG和反思技术的去偏见方法。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs存在多维国家偏见（如对西方国家的偏好偏见、对俄罗斯的不利偏见），且偏见方向和程度随模型和任务变化。具有更强推理能力的模型偏见更少。提出的去偏见框架有效减少了偏见，特别是在GPT-4o-mini和LLama-3.3-70B中。

Conclusion: LLMs的国家层面偏见具有多维特性，在IR领域应用时需要同时评估偏见和性能。结合RAG和反思技术的去偏见方法能有效改善模型表现。

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ΠAttention是一种周期性稀疏Transformer，通过将注意力分解为环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，在保持线性复杂度的同时扩展了感受野，在语言建模等任务中优于密集注意力和RingAttention。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次复杂度限制了长序列建模能力，现有稀疏注意力机制如RingAttention虽然降低了计算成本，但存在感受野有限和缺乏适应性的问题。

Method: 提出ΠAttention，将注意力分解为三个组件：环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，通过周期性结构实现可预测的远距离token覆盖。

Result: ΠAttention在语言建模、检索和视觉语言任务中达到或超过密集注意力的质量，困惑度比RingAttention低8.3%，相同上下文长度下GPU使用量减少50%。

Conclusion: 周期性跳跃、自适应融合和头级稀疏协调对于高效长上下文建模至关重要，ΠAttention在保持线性复杂度的同时显著扩展了感受野。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

This corpus is the first open source and publicly available speech translation corpus of Code-Switching Tunisian dialect. We believe that this is a valuable resource that can motivate and facilitate further research on the natural language processing of Tunisian Dialect.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在教育评估任务中的应用日益增多，但其在真实课堂环境中与人类评估的一致性尚未得到充分研究，需要验证LLM在实际教学评估中的可行性。

Method: 收集约50名学生的五次测验简答题和14个团队的项目报告，使用GPT-4o进行自动评分，并与课程助教独立进行的人工评分进行对比分析。

Result: GPT-4o与人类评分者达到高度相关性（最高0.98），在55%的测验案例中得分完全一致；对于项目报告也显示出与人工评分的整体一致性，但在技术性开放答案评分上存在一定变异性。

Conclusion: LLM在教育评估中具有潜力但也存在局限性，本研究为推进真实学术环境中自动评分系统的发展做出了贡献，并发布了所有代码和样本数据以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

Motivation: LLM驱动的智能应用存在非确定性行为，可能形成隐藏的执行循环，无声消耗资源而不触发显式错误，传统可观测性平台无法检测这些代价高昂的低效问题。

Result: 在LangGraph股票市场应用的1575条轨迹上评估，混合方法F1得分为0.72（精确率0.62，召回率0.86），显著优于单一结构方法（F1:0.08）和语义方法（F1:0.28）。

Conclusion: 虽然结果令人鼓舞，但仍有很大改进空间，未来工作需要完善方法并解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

Conclusion: 理解枢轴语言机制对于改进LLMs中的多语言对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Motivation: 随着LLM在各种任务中作为评判者的应用日益增多，需要了解它们在需要社交或对话判断的任务中是否可靠，特别是当任务从直接事实查询转变为对话判断任务时。

Method: 通过对比模型在直接事实查询中的表现与在最小对话中评估说话者正确性的表现，并施加简单的反驳压力来测量模型在对话压力下维持立场的坚定程度。

Result: 研究发现GPT-4o-mini在社交框架任务中表现出谄媚倾向，而Llama-8B-Instruct变得过度批判，所有模型的平均性能变化为9.24%。

Conclusion: 对话框架是LLM评估的关键因素，提出的框架为诊断模型信念提供了可复现的方法论，有助于开发更可信的对话系统。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Conclusion: 揭示了影响负向偏见的多种因素，为在LLMs中减轻负向偏见提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Method: 基于9个现有专家标注的实体链接数据集构建MedPath，将所有实体使用UMLS最新版本进行标准化，映射到62个其他生物医学词汇表，并在最多11个生物医学词汇表中丰富完整的本体路径。

Result: 创建了一个大规模多领域的生物医学实体链接数据集，为训练和评估语义丰富、可解释的实体链接系统提供了资源。

Conclusion: MedPath直接启用了生物医学NLP的新研究前沿，促进了语义丰富和可解释实体链接系统的训练和评估，以及下一代可互操作和可解释临床NLP模型的开发。

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

*Farima Fatahi Bayat,Pouya Pezeshkpour,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了工具增强语言模型（TaLMs）在使用代码解释器工具时出现的工具诱导短视（TIM）现象，即模型将工具输出作为推理的替代品，产生看似正确但缺乏连贯论证的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然工具增强语言模型能够调用外部工具来解决超出其参数能力的问题，但这些工具带来的性能提升是否反映可信的推理过程尚不清楚。

Method: 使用PYMATH基准测试（1,679个竞赛级数学问题），开发多维评估套件量化TaLMs相对于非工具对应模型的推理退化，并提出基于偏好优化的框架来重新调整TaLMs将工具用作辅助证据。

Result: TaLMs在最终答案准确率上获得高达19.3个百分点的提升，但其推理行为持续恶化（非工具LLMs在推理过程成对比较中获胜率高达41.5%）。工具使用越频繁，推理连贯性越差，错误从算术错误转向全局推理失败。

Conclusion: 工具使用会导致推理质量下降，但通过偏好优化框架可以改善TaLMs在工具使用下的最终答案准确率和推理深度。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use. Codes and data are available at: https://github.com/megagonlabs/TIM.

TL;DR: EMSQA是一个包含24.3K个医学问题的数据集，涵盖10个临床学科领域和4个认证级别。研究者提出了Expert-CoT和ExpertRAG方法，通过结合特定临床领域知识和认证级别来增强LLMs在医学问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在医学问答中往往忽略领域专业知识（如临床学科领域和认证级别），限制了在高风险环境下的性能。

Method: 提出了Expert-CoT（基于特定临床领域和认证级别的思维链提示策略）和ExpertRAG（基于学科对齐文档和真实患者数据的检索增强生成管道）。

Result: Expert-CoT相比普通CoT提示提升达2.05%，结合ExpertRAG相比标准RAG基线提升达4.59%准确率。32B参数的专业增强LLMs通过了所有计算机自适应EMS认证模拟考试。

Conclusion: 通过整合领域专业知识（临床学科领域和认证级别）可以显著提升LLMs在医学问答中的表现，特别是在高风险医疗环境中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating academic workflows, existing systems for academic peer review remain constrained by text-only inputs, limited contextual grounding, and a lack of actionable feedback. In this work, we present an interactive web-based system for multimodal, community-aware peer review simulation to enable effective manuscript revisions before paper submission. Our framework integrates textual and visual information through multimodal LLMs, enhances review quality via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in web-scale OpenReview data, and converts generated reviews into actionable to-do lists using the proposed Action:Objective[\#] format, providing structured and traceable guidance. The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物医学文本嵌入模型主要基于PubMed研究文献开发，而临床心脏病学实践更依赖教科书中的程序性知识和专业术语，这种研究实践差距限制了现有模型在临床心脏病学应用中的有效性。

Method: 基于Qwen3-Embedding-8B模型，使用7本综合心脏病学教科书（约15万句去重后）构建语料库，采用对比学习方法训练，使用InfoNCE损失函数和批次内负样本。

Result: 在心脏病学特定语义检索任务中达到99.60%检索准确率，比MedTE提升15.94个百分点；在MTEB医学基准测试中，BIOSSES得分为0.77 Spearman，SciFact得分为0.61 NDCG@10。

Conclusion: 基于综合临床教科书进行领域专业化训练可在心脏病学检索中实现近乎完美的性能（99.60% Acc@1），相比MedTE提升15.94个百分点，在相关生物医学领域也表现出竞争力。

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

Method: 构建了DiscoX基准数据集，包含7个专业领域的200篇专业文本；开发了Metric-S无参考评估系统，提供准确性、流畅性和适当性的细粒度自动评估。

Result: Metric-S与人类判断具有很强的一致性，显著优于现有评估指标；实验发现即使是先进的大语言模型在专业翻译任务上仍显著落后于人类专家。

Conclusion: DiscoX基准和Metric-S评估系统为更严格的翻译评估提供了稳健框架，验证了实现专业级机器翻译仍面临挑战，有助于推动基于大语言模型的翻译技术发展。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

Motivation: 目前缺乏对开源DPO数据集的系统性比较，难以理解这些数据集如何选择偏好对、覆盖哪些任务类型以及如何反映人类判断。

Method: 利用Magpie框架对样本进行任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励的标注，进行可扩展的细粒度质量检查，并基于分析结果从五个语料库中选择性构建UltraMix混合数据集。

Conclusion: 通过数据中心的偏好优化方法，可以构建更高效的DPO训练数据集，为未来的偏好优化研究提供有价值的资源。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

TL;DR: 本文发现当前文本嵌入模型存在一致的偏差，并提出了一种无需训练、轻量级的重归一化方法来解决此问题，显著提升了多种任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有文本嵌入模型输出存在系统性偏差，即所有嵌入向量都包含一个几乎相同的偏差分量，这影响了模型性能。

Method: 提出重归一化方法，有两种变体：直接从嵌入向量中减去偏差分量，或减去向量在偏差方向上的投影。

Result: 在MMTEB基准测试中，重归一化显著提升了38个模型的性能：检索任务提升9.7σ，分类任务提升3.1σ，其他任务提升0.8σ。理论预测投影方法更优，实验证实了这一点。

Conclusion: 重归一化是一种有效解决文本嵌入偏差的轻量级方法，能显著提升现有模型的性能，且投影方法优于直接减法。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Motivation: 大语言模型能生成流畅回答但有时会产生事实幻觉，需要研究模型能否检测自身的幻觉问题。

Method: 将幻觉检测制定为句子分类任务，提出基于思维链（CoT）的分类方法从模型参数中提取知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，GPT-3.5 Turbo配合CoT能检测58.2%的自身幻觉。

Conclusion: 当模型参数中包含足够知识时，配合CoT的大语言模型能够检测自身的幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过任务特定的现代语言模型适应来促进对政治传播的更深入理解，为自动检测政治辩论中的人身攻击提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在常见条件下表现优异，但在需要领域特定知识的上下文场景中难以有效利用长上下文信息，主要受限于模型上下文窗口和大量上下文噪声中相关信息的稀疏性。

Method: 提出SAP²方法，采用两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词，每阶段利用提出的语音驱动注意力池化机制，有效压缩上下文嵌入同时保留语音显著信息。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上分别达到7.71%和1.12%的词错误率，在SlideSpeech上相比非上下文基线显著降低偏置关键词错误率41.1%，在广泛上下文输入条件下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: SAP²方法有效解决了ASR系统在长上下文场景中的挑战，展示了优越的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet为名词和动词提供了丰富的超义层次结构，但副词缺乏系统的语义分类，这限制了其在自然语言处理中的应用。

Method: 开发了一个基于语言学的副词超义类型学，包含方式、时间、频率、程度、领域、说话者导向和主语导向等语义域，并通过标注研究进行实证验证。

Result: 标注研究表明，这些类别能够广泛覆盖自然文本中的副词，并且人类标注者能够可靠地分配这些类别。

Conclusion: 该类型学扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，使其更贴近语言学理论，并促进了词义消歧、事件抽取、情感分析和话语建模等下游NLP应用。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

TL;DR: LANE是一种新的对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成具有挑战性的负训练样本，旨在增强神经语言模型对目标词的细粒度语义分辨能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型往往过度拟合全局句子表示，无法捕捉局部语义细节，这限制了它们在细粒度词义分辨方面的能力。

Method: 提出LANE对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记替代词生成负训练样本，迫使模型在不同标记词的相同句子之间创建更大的可分离性。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准测试中，该方法产生了更具区分度的词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。

Conclusion: LANE方法能够更好地捕捉细微的意义差异，是模型无关的，可以集成到现有的表示学习框架中。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从知识图谱生成问答对的可扩展确定性流水线，通过聚类三元组创建可重用模板，并利用LLM增强语言质量，同时保持事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、语言质量和事实一致性方面存在不足，需要开发能够高效生成高质量问答对的解决方案，以支持教育平台和大型语言模型的开发测试。

Method: 首先基于关系聚类KG三元组，通过实体类型和关系的自然语言规则创建可重用模板；然后使用LLM模块优化模板的清晰度和连贯性；最后通过从KG中选择干扰项来实例化答案选项。

Result: 实验证明这种混合方法能够高效生成高质量的问答对，兼具可扩展性、流畅性和语言精确性。

Conclusion: 该混合方法成功结合了可扩展性和语言质量，为从知识图谱生成高质量问答对提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iMAD是一个智能多智能体辩论框架，通过选择性触发多智能体辩论来显著减少计算成本，同时提高答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体辩论框架对每个查询都进行辩论，计算成本高且可能推翻正确的单智能体答案，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: iMAD从单智能体的结构化自我批评响应中提取41个可解释的语言和语义特征，使用轻量级辩论决策分类器（采用FocusCal损失训练）来决定是否触发多智能体辩论。

Result: 在六个（视觉）问答数据集上的实验表明，iMAD显著减少了令牌使用（最多92%），同时提高了最终答案准确性（最多13.5%）。

Conclusion: iMAD框架成功实现了在保持准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本的目标，为多智能体辩论系统提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融NLP大语言模型（如BloombergGPT、FinMA等）虽然性能优异，但计算需求高，限制了众多组织的可访问性。需要开发更高效的模型部署方法。

Method: LAET策略通过分析隐藏状态表示，选择性地微调预训练LLMs中最有效的层，同时冻结不太关键的层，实现计算效率与性能的平衡。

Result: 在金融NLP任务中，LAET方法表现出强劲结果，超越了现有基准和最先进的LLMs（如GPT-4），即使使用较小的LLMs（约30亿参数）也能取得优异性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过高效可扩展的模型，将前沿金融NLP研究与实际部署连接起来，为金融应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

TL;DR: 论文反驳了Futrell和Mahowald的观点，指出语言模型通常能同样好地学习自然语言和不可能语言，困难的不可能语言只是更复杂或随机，语言模型缺乏支持人类语言习得的归纳偏置。


<details>

Motivation: 回应Futrell和Mahowald关于婴儿和语言模型都发现自然语言比不可能语言更容易学习的观点，通过文献综述澄清语言模型的实际学习能力。

Method: 回顾相关文献，分析语言模型对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现，比较学习难度与语言复杂性的关系。

Result: 语言模型通常能同等学习自然语言和许多不可能语言，困难的不可能语言主要因为其复杂性或随机性更高，而非结构的不自然性。

Conclusion: 语言模型缺乏人类语言习得所需的特定归纳偏置，这解释了它们与人类婴儿在学习语言时的差异。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

Motivation: 开发能够主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力助手，无需用户明确提示即可自动识别对话伙伴，在多对话环境中提供更好的听觉体验。

Method: 使用自我中心双耳音频，以佩戴者的自我语音为锚点，利用对话轮换行为和对话动态推断对话伙伴。采用双模型架构：轻量级流式模型每12.5毫秒运行一次用于低延迟提取对话伙伴，较慢模型运行频率较低以捕捉长距离对话动态。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着向能够主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力助手迈出了一步，为多对话环境下的听觉辅助提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Motivation: 现有评估方法在衡量模型在现实世界专业环境中的表现方面存在局限，特别是在法律和金融等高风险领域，这些领域需要评估开放式、具有经济影响的任务。

Method: 招募182名合格专业人士（持有法学博士、特许金融分析师或6年以上经验），基于实际工作流程创建任务，并通过独立专家验证的严格质量管道验证专家制定的量规。

Result: 评估20个领先模型显示改进空间很大，在困难子集上最高得分仅为0.39（金融）和0.37（法律）。模型在特定能力上存在显著差异，常见失败模式包括判断不准确、缺乏过程透明度和推理不完整。

Conclusion: 模型在专业采用方面的可靠性存在关键差距，需要改进判断准确性、过程透明度和推理完整性，才能在实际专业环境中可靠使用。

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

Conclusion: 质量度量的选择对所选解集特性具有决定性影响，新提出的有向覆盖度量方法在多目标优化中表现优异，为帕累托剪枝问题提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于团宽度的抽象论证问题编码方法，提出了线性保持团宽度的有向分解引导(DDG)归约，将论证问题转化为(Q)SAT问题，并证明了该归约方法在合理假设下无法显著改进。

Motivation: 虽然现代SAT求解器在小树宽实例上表现高效，但对于更一般的团宽度参数，编码能力的研究还很有限。抽象论证框架作为基于有向图的推理系统，是研究计算性质的理想候选。

Method: 设计了从论证问题到(Q)SAT的新归约方法，即线性保持团宽度的有向分解引导(DDG)归约，适用于所有论证语义包括计数问题。

Result: 建立了所有论证语义的新结果，证明了DDG归约导致的额外开销在合理假设下无法显著降低。

Conclusion: 本文开启了基于团宽度的编码能力研究，提出的DDG归约为抽象论证问题提供了有效的(Q)SAT编码方案，且其性能接近最优。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Motivation: 在不确定性下的反事实决策中，决策者需要比较候选行动的预期潜在结果。传统方法存在局限，需要新的决策规则来更好地评估行动偏好。

Method: 引入PoR和PoB两个新指标，建立识别定理和边界，开发估计方法，并通过数值实验和真实数据集应用进行验证。

Result: 成功建立了PoR和PoB的识别理论框架，推导了边界条件，提出的估计器在有限样本下表现良好，并在实际数据中展示了应用价值。

Conclusion: PoR和PoB为反事实决策提供了新的有效工具，能够更准确地评估个体层面的行动偏好和结果概率，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HyperComplEx混合嵌入框架，通过注意力机制自适应结合双曲、复数和欧几里得空间，解决了现有知识图谱嵌入方法在处理多样化关系类型时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法在处理大规模多样化关系类型时存在关键限制：欧几里得模型难以处理层次结构，向量空间模型无法捕捉非对称性，双曲模型在对称关系上表现不佳。

Method: 采用关系特定的空间加权策略，通过学习注意力机制动态选择每个关系类型的最优几何空间，并使用多空间一致性损失确保跨空间预测的一致性。

Result: 在计算机科学研究知识图谱上评估，从1K论文到10M论文规模均优于现有最佳基线模型。在10M论文数据集上达到0.612 MRR，相对最佳基线提升4.8%，推理效率为85ms每三元组。

Conclusion: HyperComplEx通过自适应几何空间组合和维度分配，实现了对多样化关系类型的有效建模，并在大规模知识图谱上展现出优越性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Motivation: 传统交通事故重建依赖人类专家，在处理不完整多模态数据时往往产生不一致结果，需要开发更精确可靠的自动化重建方法。

Method: 采用两阶段协作框架：第一阶段从多模态输入生成自然语言事故重建，第二阶段结合时间事件数据记录器进行深度事故推理。处理277个追尾前车减速碰撞案例，整合文本报告、结构化数据和视觉场景图。

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型作为专家指导的新框架，从不规则采样的纵向患者数据中学习神经退行性疾病进展，同时优化长期疾病轨迹构建和生物约束的脑区交互图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测神经退行性疾病（如阿尔茨海默病）进展时，通常过度简化脑连接性关系，假设单一模态的脑连接组作为疾病传播基质，导致长期进展期预测不准确。而纯数据驱动方法由于缺乏适当约束面临可识别性问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型作为专家指导，综合多模态关系并整合多种疾病驱动机制，同时优化个体水平观察的长期疾病轨迹构建和生物约束的脑区交互图结构。使用阿尔茨海默病队列的tau-PET成像数据进行验证。

Result: 新框架在预测准确性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，同时揭示了超出传统连接性测量的额外疾病驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合大语言模型的专家知识，能够更准确地学习神经退行性疾病的进展模式，为理解疾病传播机制提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体法律验证器，通过专业化分工和协调推理，在AI驱动的数据传输规划中提高法律合规性检查的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在严格的隐私法规（如日本个人信息保护法APPI）下，AI驱动的数据传输规划中的法律合规性变得越来越重要，需要开发可扩展且符合法规的自动化合规验证框架。

Method: 设计多智能体法律验证器，将合规检查分解为法规解释、业务背景评估和风险评估三个专业智能体，通过结构化综合协议进行协调。

Result: 在200个APPI第16条修正案案例数据集上，系统达到72%的准确率，比单智能体基线提高21个百分点，在明确合规案例中达到90%准确率（基线为16%），同时保持对明确违规的完美检测。

Conclusion: 领域专业化和协调推理能够显著提高法律AI性能，为可信赖和可解释的自动化合规验证提供了可扩展且符合法规的框架。

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束编程中，抽象结构（如嵌套集合）需要转换为求解器支持的表示形式。对称性破坏技术可以显著加速求解过程，但应用于抽象变量时会产生大量复杂约束，实际性能较差。

Method: 提出一种新的不完全对称性破坏方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示方式来打破对称性，特别针对不可区分对象产生的对称性问题。

Conclusion: 通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示方式，可以开发出更有效的对称性破坏方法，在保持不完全性的同时获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Motivation: 多智能体辩论(MAD)在提升LLM推理能力方面显示出潜力，但角色分配策略这一关键方面尚未充分探索。本研究旨在系统研究角色分配策略对MAD性能的影响。

Method: 提出"真理最后"角色分配策略，并设计了多智能体辩论一致性(MADC)策略，通过路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，模拟一致性得分最高的角色作为真理。

Result: 在9个LLM模型(包括DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型)的挑战性推理任务上验证，MADC策略持续表现出先进性能，有效克服了MAD的性能瓶颈，性能提升最高达22%。

Conclusion: MADC策略为LLM智能体扩展提供了关键改进路径，通过系统模拟和优化多智能体辩论的核心机制，显著提升了推理任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，规划对于避免碰撞和在复杂密集交通场景中导航至关重要。传统方法在学习策略、状态预测器和评估器时面临挑战。

Method: 提出DSS框架，利用可微分模拟器Waymax作为状态预测器和评估器，通过梯度下降在想象的未来轨迹上优化动作序列。

Result: 实验表明，DSS结合规划梯度和随机搜索，在跟踪和路径规划精度上显著优于序列预测、模仿学习、无模型RL和其他规划方法。

Conclusion: DSS框架通过利用可微分模拟器的硬编码动力学和可微分特性，有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的动作序列搜索问题。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习有效的广义规划和状态空间剪枝公理，为广义规划提供了一种简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics.

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Motivation: 现有MARL方法大多假设通信是瞬时、可靠且带宽无限的，但这些条件在现实部署中很少满足，因此需要研究在现实约束下的鲁棒高效通信策略。

Method: 系统调查和综述近期在多智能体强化学习中应对现实通信约束（包括消息扰动、传输延迟、有限带宽）的通信策略进展，并分析三个具体应用案例。

Result: 识别了低延迟可靠性、带宽密集型数据共享和通信隐私权衡等核心挑战，提出了将通信、学习和鲁棒性协同设计的统一方法。

Conclusion: 需要通过通信、学习和鲁棒性的协同设计来弥合理论MARL模型与实际实现之间的差距，并指出了未来的关键开放挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Conclusion: 多模态EHR整合有潜力增强临床决策制定并改善患者结果。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
