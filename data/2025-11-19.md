### [1] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个解决开放集识别中过度自信问题的框架，通过参数扰动估计预测不确定性，并使用两阶段分类器来更好地区分已知和未知类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集识别中，当未知样本与已知类别语义相似时，特征空间中的类间重叠会导致模型对未知样本赋予过高置信度，造成过度自信问题，从而模糊已知与未知类别的决策边界。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：基于扰动的预测不确定性估计模块（通过可控参数扰动生成多样化预测来量化不确定性）和具有不同学习分类器的未知检测模块（作为两阶段过程，利用估计的不确定性改进已知与未知类别的区分）。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的框架在开放集识别性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式缓解由类间重叠引起的过度自信问题，有效提升了开放集识别的性能。

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [2] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的对象感知时序建模方法，用于解决少样本视频目标检测问题，通过选择性传播高置信度对象特征来提高检测精度和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法需要大量训练数据，而少样本视频目标检测面临时序一致性保持和新型对象泛化的挑战，特别是在遮挡和外观变化的情况下。

Method: 采用过滤机制选择性传播高置信度对象特征，结合少样本训练检测和分类头，实现高效特征传播而不依赖复杂的区域提议。

Result: 在5-shot设置下，AP指标在FSVOD-500、FSYTV-40、VidOR和VidVRD数据集上分别提升3.7%、5.3%、4.3%和4.5%。1-shot、3-shot和10-shot配置也显示出改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了少样本视频目标检测中的时序一致性和新型对象泛化问题，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流匹配的图像融合方法FusionFM，通过直接概率传输从源模态到融合图像分布，提高采样效率和结构一致性，同时引入任务感知选择函数和融合精炼模块来优化伪标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法依赖任务特定模型，训练成本高且可扩展性有限；生成方法采样效率低。需要一种统一建模方法，既能提高采样效率，又能保证结构一致性。

Method: 1. 将图像融合建模为从源模态到融合图像的直接概率传输，采用流匹配范式；2. 收集多个SOTA模型的融合结果作为先验，使用任务感知选择函数选择可靠伪标签；3. 引入融合精炼模块，采用分治策略识别、分解和增强伪标签中的退化组件；4. 多任务场景下集成弹性权重巩固和经验回放机制。

Conclusion: FusionFM通过流匹配范式为多模态图像融合提供了一种高效统一的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著改善了采样效率，具有良好的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [4] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段无轨迹碰撞检测框架，使用扩散模型生成合理的未来路段地图，并通过比较监控路段地图与生成结果来检测碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时碰撞检测对于开发主动安全管理策略和提高交通效率至关重要，需要解决轨迹获取和车辆跟踪的局限性。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用Mapfusion扩散模型生成未来路段地图，通过噪声添加和去噪过程，结合时间动态嵌入和ControlNet背景上下文；第二阶段通过比较监控地图与生成结果进行碰撞检测。

Result: Mapfusion成功生成了基于学习运动模式的真实路段演化地图，在不同采样间隔下保持鲁棒性，在真实世界碰撞实验中准确检测碰撞。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法在准确检测碰撞方面表现出有效性，为实时碰撞检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [5] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对地震数据的自适应双网格基础模型训练策略（ADATG），结合希尔伯特编码，通过频谱分解分离高低频分量，并采用自适应训练策略从粗粒度到细粒度逐步优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于地震数据具有独特的特征，需要专门的处理技术来预训练基础模型。现有的视觉变换器（ViTs）忽略了地震数据的内在模式，无法有效捕捉高低频信息。

Method: 采用自适应双网格基础模型训练策略，结合频谱分解分离高低频分量，使用分层希尔伯特编码表示数据，并实施从粗到细的自适应训练策略。

Result: 广泛的实验证明了该训练方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了基于地震图像高低频特征的数据编码和训练策略的重要性，有助于增强视觉地震基础模型的预训练效果。

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [6] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一种基于面部微动态分析的被动痴呆筛查方法，通过分析眨眼动态、嘴部运动、注视变化和头部微调等面部运动特征，实现无需语言或文本的早期神经认知变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有痴呆筛查方法依赖语音或脚本访谈，限制了在临床外的应用，且预测结果与语言和转录紧密耦合。本研究旨在开发一种无需语言、可跨设备、主题和文化使用的被动筛查方法。

Method: 通过稳定面部信号，将微运动转换为可解释的面部微动态时间序列，平滑处理后将短窗口汇总为紧凑的片段级统计特征。每个窗口通过其活动混合（跨运动流的相对运动份额）进行编码，分析运动分布而非幅度。

Result: 在YT DemTalk数据集上，消融实验发现注视不稳定性和嘴部/下颌动态是最具信息量的线索，轻量级分类器实现了AUROC 0.953、AP 0.961、F1分数0.851和准确率0.857的痴呆预测性能。

Conclusion: 面部时间微动态分析为无语言痴呆筛查提供了有效方法，能够在自然环境中进行大规模分析，且不依赖临床干预，具有很好的跨设备和文化适应性。

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [7] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe是一个基于认知科学的视觉推理基准测试框架，将链式帧推理分解为6个认知维度和24个子任务，首次对视频模型作为推理器进行定量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注保真度或对齐性，无法评估链式帧推理能力，阻碍了对模型核心认知能力的系统理解和改进指导。

Method: 通过多源数据整理、最小提示协议和混合VLM辅助评估，将链式帧推理分解为6个认知维度：从感知逻辑到抽象规划。

Result: 对最先进系统的实验显示，视觉质量与推理深度之间存在显著差异，建立了基准和诊断工具。

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe为推进真正的世界模拟器提供了基础，揭示了当前视频生成模型在推理能力方面的局限性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [8] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出基于排序的损失函数来解决基于热图的人体姿态估计中的三个主要问题：MSE损失无法有效提升关节定位精度、热图的空间和类别不平衡、以及评估指标与损失函数之间的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的热图方法存在三个核心问题：(1) MSE损失对所有像素偏差同等惩罚，无法有效提升关节定位精度；(2) 热图存在空间和类别不平衡；(3) 评估指标(mAP)与损失函数之间存在差异。

Method: 提出基于排序的损失函数，通过理论分析和实证研究证明其优于常用的热图损失(MSE、KL散度)。该方法提高了置信度分数与定位质量之间的相关性，从而在NMS过程中实现更准确的实例选择。

Result: RSPose在COCO-val数据集上达到79.9 mAP，优于之前的最先进方法。同时将SimCC Resnet-50在COCO-val上的性能提升了1.5 AP，达到73.6 AP。在COCO、CrowdPose和MPII三个数据集上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了与评估指标(mAP)对齐的损失函数用于人体姿态估计，通过基于排序的损失函数有效解决了热图方法的核心问题，显著提升了姿态估计性能。

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [9] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出碰撞声源分割任务(CS3)，旨在根据碰撞声音在视频中分割出产生声音的物体，专注于第一人称视角视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类多感官感知能力启发，希望从碰撞声音中识别出产生声音的物体，解决第一人称视角中视觉场景杂乱、物体小、交互短暂等挑战。

Method: 提出弱监督的音频条件分割方法，利用基础模型(CLIP和SAM2)，并整合第一人称线索(如手中物体)来识别可能的碰撞声源物体。

Result: 在两个新基准数据集EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3上，方法比竞争基线在mIoU指标上分别高出3倍和4.7倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决碰撞声源分割任务，在第一人称视频中准确识别产生碰撞声音的物体。

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

TL;DR: 本文提出了H-CNN-ViT模型用于膀胱癌复发预测，通过分层门控注意力多分支架构融合全局和局部特征，在自建的多序列MRI数据集上达到78.6%的AUC，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膀胱癌复发率高达78%，术后监测至关重要。多序列增强MRI是常用检测方法，但术后组织变化使判读困难，且缺乏专门用于复发评估的MRI数据集阻碍了AI辅助诊断工具的发展。

Method: 首先构建专门用于膀胱癌复发预测的多序列多模态MRI数据集，然后提出H-CNN-ViT模型，采用分层门控注意力多分支架构，通过门控机制选择性加权全局(ViT)和局部(CNN)路径特征，各模态独立处理以优化特征捕获和融合。

Result: 在自建数据集上评估，H-CNN-ViT模型达到78.6%的AUC，超越了现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: H-CNN-ViT模型通过有效的特征融合策略在膀胱癌复发预测任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了有价值的基准数据集和模型架构。

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

### [11] [QwenCLIP: Boosting Medical Vision-Language Pretraining via LLM Embeddings and Prompt tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13876)
*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP是一个视觉语言框架，用基于大语言模型的嵌入模块替换CLIP的文本编码器，通过可学习提示增强跨模态对齐，解决了CLIP在长文本医学报告处理上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的文本编码器最多只能处理77个token，无法有效表示信息丰富的长篇幅放射学报告。现有的领域特定编码器如PubMedBERT或ClinicalBERT虽然有所改进，但仍受限于512个token的输入长度和相对浅层的语义理解。

Method: 提出QwenCLIP框架，用基于大语言模型的嵌入模块（如Qwen3-Embedding）替换CLIP的文本编码器，并引入可学习提示来增强跨模态对齐，利用LLM的扩展上下文窗口和更丰富的表示能力。

Result: QwenCLIP能够从长篇临床文本中捕捉全面的医学语义，显著改善了医学图像-文本对齐，并在放射学基准测试中提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用大语言模型的扩展上下文能力和丰富表示，QwenCLIP有效解决了CLIP在长文本医学报告处理上的限制，为医学视觉语言任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

Conclusion: 该架构克服了传统迁移学习方法在医学图像处理中的限制，为医学图像自动诊断工具的开发做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

Conclusion: 该方法为将视觉语言模型集成到可靠且可解释的自动驾驶系统中提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

TL;DR: SAE-MCVT是首个可扩展的实时多摄像头车辆跟踪框架，通过边缘计算和中心工作站协同工作，在保持实时性能的同时实现城市规模部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCVT研究过于关注准确性而忽视实时性和可扩展性，这在城市规模应用中随着摄像头数量增加变得日益重要。

Method: 系统包含边缘设备和中央工作站。边缘端处理RTSP视频流，进行目标检测、跟踪、地理映射和特征提取，仅传输轻量级元数据。中央端基于自监督相机链接模型计算跨摄像头关联。

Result: 在RoundaboutHD数据集上，SAE-MCVT能在2K 15FPS视频流上保持实时操作，IDF1得分达到61.2。

Conclusion: 这是首个适合城市规模部署的可扩展实时MCVT框架，解决了现有方法在实时性和可扩展性方面的不足。

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Method: 使用从学校教科书中收集的交通标志和道路安全规范图像构建试点数据集，在零样本设置下评估模型能力。

Result: 初步结果显示这些模型在安全推理方面表现不佳，存在性能差距。

Conclusion: 多模态LLMs在道路安全概念理解上存在明显不足，需要进一步研究来弥合这些差距。

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

TL;DR: CuRPO是一种基于课程学习的相对策略优化方法，通过使用CoT长度和gIoU奖励作为复杂性指标，从简单到复杂逐步训练视觉定位模型，解决了传统CoT方法在复杂场景下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现基于强化学习的CoT推理在视觉定位任务中会随着CoT输出变长或复杂而性能下降，且增加数据集规模并不总能提升性能。这促使开发一种能够根据数据复杂性进行渐进式训练的方法。

Method: 提出CuRPO训练策略，利用CoT长度和广义交并比(gIoU)奖励作为复杂性指标，将训练数据从简单到复杂进行结构化组织，实现渐进式学习。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和LISA数据集上的实验表明，CuRPO显著优于现有方法，在RefCOCO上mAP提升高达+12.52，且在少样本学习场景下表现出优异的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CuRPO通过课程学习策略有效解决了复杂视觉定位任务中的性能退化问题，特别适用于文本描述模糊复杂的任务，展示了卓越的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

Conclusion: 这种方法为数据高效和领域无关的预训练策略提供了有前景的新路径。

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Motivation: 解决当前技能评估模型局限于单一运动项目，且专家级监督成本高、稀缺的问题，探索可迁移的视频表示方法。

Method: 发现跨运动边界的技能属性，训练多模态语言模型生成针对新视频的可操作反馈和熟练度评估。

Conclusion: 通过抽象出指示人类技能的共享行为，所提出的视频表示方法比现有技术泛化能力更强，丰富了当今的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

Motivation: 解决室内场景理解中光学传感器存在的遮挡问题和隐私风险，同时克服毫米波雷达低空间分辨率的限制，实现稳健且保护隐私的室内场景理解。

Method: 提出双角度多径增强方法，显式建模到达角和离开角以恢复次级反射；采用仿真到现实的层次扩散框架，将碎片化的雷达响应转换为完整的布局重建和物体检测。

Result: 在布局重建方面将Chamfer距离降低60%（降至16厘米），首次实现基于毫米波的物体检测，达到58%的IoU；构建了包含5万帧数据的大规模基准数据集。

Conclusion: RISE为使用单静态雷达实现几何感知和保护隐私的室内场景理解建立了新的基础，证明了多径反射在揭示不可见结构方面的价值。

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

Motivation: 传统主动学习在医学图像分割中面临边界模糊、标注劳动密集和认知负担重的问题，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出LINGUAL框架，通过上下文学习将专家自然语言指令转化为可执行程序，自动执行相应子任务序列。

Result: 在主动领域自适应任务中，LINGUAL达到与主动学习基线相当或更优的性能，同时估计标注时间减少约80%。

Conclusion: 语言引导为医学图像分割提供了一种高效替代方案，显著降低专家标注负担，同时保持或提升性能。

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

Conclusion: WaRPAD提供了一种有效的无需训练AI生成图像检测方案，利用自监督模型的表示一致性特性，在多样数据集和生成模型上表现出色，具有良好的通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

TL;DR: SCAR是一种用于自回归模型的语义上下文驱动方法，通过压缩语义预填充和语义对齐指导来解决图像编辑中的条件限制问题，在保持可控性的同时提升视觉保真度和语义对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成方面表现出强大潜力，但在扩展到通用图像编辑时面临条件限制弱、效率低的问题，导致指令遵循差和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出SCAR方法，包含两个关键组件：压缩语义预填充（将高层语义编码为紧凑高效的前缀）和语义对齐指导（在自回归解码过程中将最后视觉隐藏状态与目标语义对齐）。

Result: SCAR在指令编辑和可控生成基准测试中实现了卓越的视觉保真度和语义对齐，优于先前的基于自回归的方法。

Conclusion: SCAR克服了基于向量量化的预填充方法的语义限制和高成本问题，在保持可控性的同时显著提升了图像编辑性能。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

*Jingyu Lei,Gaoang Wang,Der-Horng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE提出了一种新的视觉token压缩范式，通过对象分割生成语义先验来指导token合并，实现高效的大视觉语言模型处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token压缩方法缺乏高层次语义理解，导致次优合并、信息冗余或上下文丢失，需要更有效的压缩方法。

Method: 使用高效分割解码器生成对象掩码作为语义先验，指导视觉token合并为紧凑的对象中心表示，并采用质心引导排序机制恢复空间顺序。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中达到最先进水平，在自适应率设置下效率显著提升，极端压缩下仅保留2.2%视觉token仍能维持97.4%基线性能。

Conclusion: 对象中心表示在大视觉语言模型的高效处理中具有优越性，为视觉token压缩提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分析中依赖大规模标注数据的瓶颈问题，特别是在罕见病领域数据稀缺的情况下，突破传统深度学习对大数据集的依赖。

Method: 提出语义引导参数合成器(SGPS)，利用预训练生成引擎将多模态任务信息(单张图像和临床文本)直接合成为轻量级分类器的权重参数，无需任务特定训练。

Result: 在ISIC 2018皮肤病变数据集和自定义罕见病数据集上，SGPS在1-shot和5-shot分类中显著优于现有few-shot和zero-shot学习方法，建立新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI诊断工具在数据极度有限的罕见病领域的快速开发和部署开辟了新途径，特别适用于长尾分布中的罕见疾病场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DEER-3D框架，通过错误驱动的3D场景编辑生成针对性反事实数据，解决3D-LLMs在语言到视觉空间元素准确接地方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D-LLMs在准确将语言接地到3D环境中的视觉和空间元素方面存在限制，主要由于训练数据偏向语言推理而非空间理解，且缺乏3D资源导致固有接地偏见未解决。

Method: 提出DEER-3D框架，采用"分解、诊断评估、编辑、重新训练"工作流程。首先诊断3D-LLM的接地失败，识别谓词级错误（如属性或空间关系），然后执行最小化的谓词对齐3D场景编辑（如重新着色或重新定位），生成针对性反事实监督数据进行迭代模型微调。

Result: 在多个3D接地和场景理解任务的基准测试中评估编辑流程，通过迭代精炼在所有评估数据集上一致显示出改进。

Conclusion: DEER-3D强调了针对性、错误驱动的场景编辑在弥合3D LLMs中语言推理能力与空间接地方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出BCE3S方法，通过二元交叉熵的三方协同学习解决长尾识别问题，提升特征紧凑性和类间可分性，平衡分类器向量分离度，在多个长尾数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于交叉熵损失的长尾识别方法难以学习具有理想特性的特征，且在Softmax分母中耦合了不平衡的分类器向量，放大了长尾识别中的不平衡效应。

Method: BCE3S包含三个组件：基于BCE的联合学习优化分类器和样本特征；基于BCE的对比学习提升特征类内紧凑性；基于BCE的均匀学习平衡分类器向量分离度并与联合学习交互增强特征特性。

Result: 在CIFAR10-LT、CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist2018等长尾数据集上的广泛实验表明，BCE3S训练的长尾识别模型实现了更高的特征紧凑性和可分性，同时平衡了分类器的分离度。

Conclusion: BCE3S方法通过三方协同学习有效解决了长尾识别中的特征学习和分类器平衡问题，在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

Motivation: 现有的All-in-One图像修复方法通常依赖任务特定设计或潜在路由策略，难以适应具有各种退化的真实场景。需要开发一个统一且可解释的解决方案来处理复杂的退化情况。

Method: 1. 使用冻结的多模态大语言模型作为规划器分析退化图像并生成频率感知修复计划；2. 在基于扩散的执行器中采用LoRA-MoE模块，动态选择高频或低频专家；3. 引入对抗训练和频率正则化损失来提升修复质量并减少伪影。

Result: 在七个修复任务上的广泛实验表明，FAPE-IR实现了最先进的性能，并在混合退化条件下表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将语义规划与基于频率的修复相结合，FAPE-IR为All-in-One图像修复提供了一个统一且可解释的解决方案，能够有效处理复杂的真实世界退化场景。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要用户提供精确的空间位置和时间边界描述，但在用户使用语义属性或对象关系的隐式查询时变得不实用。

Method: RIVER通过数字孪生表示解耦推理和生成，利用大语言模型进行多跳推理，生成结构化指令指导基于扩散的编辑器执行像素级修改，并使用强化学习训练。

Result: RIVER在提出的RVEBenchmark上表现最佳，并在VegGIE和FiVE两个额外基准测试中超越六个基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RIVER成功解决了推理视频编辑任务，能够有效处理隐式查询，为视频编辑提供了更直观和语义驱动的交互方式。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono成功解决了自监督单目深度估计模型在实际部署中的性能与效率平衡问题，为自动驾驶和机器人导航提供了实用的实时深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

Conclusion: 所提出的非对称聚合方法能有效处理视觉位置识别中的分布差异问题，通过几何约束增强了空间感知能力，显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Method: 采用四阶段统一框架：事件触发多视角视频采集、行人行为阶段分割、阶段特定多视角推理、层次化合成与诊断推理，使用两个专用VLM模型进行阶段分割和多视角分析。

Conclusion: MP-PVIR成功将多视角视频数据转化为可操作的洞察，推进了车路协同系统中AI驱动的交通安全分析。

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wave-Former是一种利用毫米波无线信号进行3D形状重建的新方法，能够穿透常见遮挡物对隐藏物体进行高精度重建，在机器人、增强现实和物流等领域有应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毫米波重建方法存在覆盖范围有限和噪声高的问题，无法有效处理完全被遮挡的日常物体。Wave-Former旨在解决这些限制，实现更准确的3D形状重建。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：提出候选几何表面、使用专门为毫米波信号设计的基于transformer的形状补全模型、进行熵引导的表面选择。该方法结合了毫米波信号的物理特性与基于视觉的形状补全技术。

Result: 与最先进基线方法相比，Wave-Former将召回率从54%提升到72%，同时保持85%的高精度。该方法仅使用合成点云训练，但在真实世界数据上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Wave-Former通过物理感知的形状补全模型，成功实现了对完全被遮挡物体的高精度3D重建，在毫米波重建领域取得了显著进步。

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

TL;DR: 本文提出RiSe框架解决多模态人脸反欺诈中的跨域泛化问题，通过非对称不变风险最小化和多模态协同解耦来应对表示风险和协同风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态人脸反欺诈方法在未见域中性能下降比单模态更严重，主要由于两个被忽视的风险：模态表示不变风险和模态协同不变风险。

Method: 提出RiSe框架，包含AsyIRM学习径向空间的不变球形决策边界，以及MMSD通过跨样本混合和解耦增强内在模态特征。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证了RiSe的有效性，在跨域性能上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: RiSe框架成功解决了多模态人脸反欺诈中的跨域泛化问题，通过处理表示和协同风险实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVI-Bench是首个专门评估误导性视觉输入对大型视觉语言模型稳健性影响的基准，包含1,248个专家标注的VQA实例，涵盖视觉概念、属性和关系三个层次，并提出了细粒度评估指标MVI-Sensitivity。

Motivation: 现有稳健性基准主要关注幻觉或误导性文本输入，而忽视了误导性视觉输入对视觉理解评估的重要性，需要填补这一重要空白。

Method: 基于基础视觉原语，设计了三个层次误导性视觉输入：视觉概念、视觉属性和视觉关系，构建了六个代表性类别，并开发了MVI-Sensitivity细粒度评估指标。

Result: 对18个最先进LVLM的实证研究揭示了它们对误导性视觉输入的显著脆弱性，深度分析为开发更可靠的LVLM提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: MVI-Bench填补了误导性视觉输入评估的空白，揭示了LVLM的脆弱性，为开发更稳健的模型提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对象级token合并的自适应token压缩策略，仅使用10%的token就能达到原始模型96%的性能，解决了MLLMs中patch级token化导致的二次增长问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的patch级token化导致图像token数量呈二次增长，增加了计算和内存负担，且与人类视觉认知系统不一致，导致幻觉和计算冗余。

Method: 提出对象级token合并策略进行自适应token压缩，该方法与人类视觉系统保持一致。

Result: 在多个综合基准测试中，平均仅使用10%的token就能达到原始模型96%的性能，在压缩比和性能平衡方面优于相关工作。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MLLMs中token数量过多的问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法针对单一退化问题开发高度专业化的模型，缺乏可扩展性且未能利用这些修复问题的共享本质。而通用模型需要详细提示且在这些细粒度任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建包含380万对图像的大规模数据集，包含新颖的物理可信数据填补公共基准的关键空白；定制训练流程，微调扩散变换器从多样化数据中学习鲁棒修复先验，集成细粒度掩码和强度控制。

Conclusion: 通过利用软效应的共同本质（半透明遮挡），UniSER证明了在单一框架内处理多样化退化问题的可行性，为图像修复提供了新的基础模型方法。

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

TL;DR: GloTok提出了一种全局视角的tokenization方法，通过代码本直方图关系学习来建模更均匀的语义分布，并结合残差学习模块恢复细节，在ImageNet-1k上实现了最先进的图像重建和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像tokenization方法使用局部监督方式进行语义监督，限制了语义分布的均匀性。而VA-VAE证明更均匀的特征分布能带来更好的生成性能。

Method: 1. 代码本直方图关系学习方法：将预训练模型在整个数据集上建模的语义转移到语义代码本；2. 残差学习模块：恢复量化造成的细节损失，最小化重建误差。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k基准测试中，GloTok实现了最先进的重建性能和生成质量，无需在训练过程中直接访问预训练模型。

Conclusion: GloTok通过全局关系建模和残差学习，生成了更均匀分布的语义潜在表示，有效提升了自回归模型的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法在分割精度和效率方面均有显著改进，适合实时临床应用，代码已公开。

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24. The code for fractal softmax will be available at https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/fractal-softmax.

Conclusion: DetGain作为一种通用且互补的策略，在数据高效目标检测方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

TL;DR: InstantViR是一个基于预训练视频扩散先验的超快速视频重建框架，通过将双向视频扩散模型蒸馏为因果自回归学生模型，在单次前向传播中完成视频恢复，实现了35+ FPS的实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法在视频重建中的问题：基于图像扩散的方法存在时间伪影，而原生视频扩散模型的迭代后验采样速度太慢，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 将强大的双向视频扩散模型（教师）蒸馏为因果自回归学生模型，仅需教师扩散模型和已知退化算子，无需外部配对数据；使用LeanVAE替换视频扩散主干VAE，通过教师空间正则化蒸馏方案实现低延迟潜在空间处理。

Result: 在流式随机修复、高斯去模糊和超分辨率任务中，InstantViR匹配或超越了基于扩散的基线方法的重建质量，在NVIDIA A100 GPU上运行速度超过35 FPS，比迭代视频扩散求解器快达100倍。

Conclusion: 扩散基视频重建与实时、交互式、可编辑的流式场景兼容，使高质量视频恢复成为现代视觉系统的实用组件。

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的语音驱动3D面部动画方法在处理整个音频序列时存在两个主要问题：当音频序列超过训练时长时性能下降，以及处理长音频输入时延迟显著。

Method: 提出自回归扩散模型，以流式方式处理输入音频。选择有限数量的过去帧作为历史运动上下文，与音频输入结合创建动态条件，引导扩散过程迭代生成面部运动帧。

Conclusion: 所提出的流式自回归扩散模型有效解决了长音频序列处理问题，实现了实时高质量的语音驱动3D面部动画。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击多采用2D补丁并主要针对单目感知，而针对立体双目深度估计的物理对抗攻击效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出3D物理对抗样本，采用全局伪装纹理；开发3D立体匹配渲染模块处理相机视差效应；提出新颖的融合攻击方法，通过细粒度优化将目标无缝融入环境。

Result: 广泛评估表明，所提出的物理对抗样本能成功欺骗立体模型产生错误的深度信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在现有隐藏攻击基础上显著提升了隐蔽性和杀伤力，能够有效对抗立体视觉系统。

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

Conclusion: WeSTAR框架通过弱监督自训练适应和正则化，有效增强了单目深度估计基础模型在未见领域的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 现有WMH自动分割方法主要提供全局病变负荷，忽视不同白质区域的空间分布，需要开发能够量化区域WMH负荷的方法。

Method: 使用深度学习框架进行WMH分割和定位，在公共数据集和ADNI队列中评估，量化解剖定义区域内的WMH负荷，并与脑结构体积结合评估诊断价值。

Result: 预测病变负荷与参考WMH估计一致，区域WMH体积在疾病分类中持续优于全局病变负担，结合脑萎缩指标AUC值可达0.97，前部白质束等特定区域与诊断状态相关。

Conclusion: 区域WMH量化具有附加价值，将局部病变指标与萎缩标志物结合可增强神经退行性疾病的早期诊断和分层能力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统张量奇异值分解（t-SVD）方法存在两个关键局限：1）潜在张量近似粗糙，无法准确捕捉空间局部高频信息；2）变换矩阵由固定基原子组成，无法精确捕捉模式3纤维上的局部高频信息。

Method: 提出GSLR框架，利用定制的2D高斯泼溅生成潜在张量，1D高斯泼溅生成变换矩阵。这两种高斯泼溅在该表示框架中相互补充，具有强大的表示能力。

Conclusion: GSLR框架能够有效解决传统t-SVD方法的局限性，在多维图像表示和恢复中表现出优越性能，特别是在局部高频信息捕捉方面。

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Motivation: 准确建模阿尔茨海默病的认知衰退对于早期分层和个性化管理至关重要。虽然表格预测因子提供了全局风险的稳健标记，但它们捕捉细微脑变化的能力有限。

Conclusion: 临床特征在识别高风险极端病例方面表现出色，而基于Transformer的MRI嵌入对稳定性细微标记更敏感，这为AD进展建模的多模态融合策略提供了动机。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg在解剖结构和模态之间表现出强大的泛化能力，为计算机辅助骨科手术提供了稳健和准确的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

TL;DR: Dental3R是一个用于稀疏口腔内照片3D重建的免姿态图引导管道，通过几何感知配对策略和基于小波的3D高斯溅射，解决了传统方法在远程正畸中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: Dental3R为远程正畸提供了一种稳健、高保真的口腔3D重建解决方案，能够从稀疏照片中恢复关键诊断细节。

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ArchMap是一个无需训练的知识引导框架，用于3D口腔扫描的结构化理解，通过几何感知的牙弓展平模块和牙科知识库实现稳健的牙齿计数、解剖分区和临床状况识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖模态特定训练、大量标注数据和受控扫描条件，限制了跨设备泛化能力和临床部署。原始口腔网格存在牙弓姿态变化、几何不完整和缺乏纹理线索等问题。

Method: 引入几何感知的牙弓展平模块将原始3D网格标准化为空间对齐的多视图投影，构建包含分层牙齿本体论、牙列阶段策略和临床语义的牙科知识库来约束符号推理空间。

Result: 在1060个正畸前后病例上验证，在牙齿计数、解剖分区、牙列阶段分类以及拥挤、缺失牙、修复体和龋齿等临床状况识别方面表现稳健，相比监督方法和VLM基线具有更高准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: ArchMap证明几何标准化与本体论引导的多模态推理相结合，为现代数字正畸中3D口腔扫描的结构化分析提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

TL;DR: DentalSCR是一个用于口腔内扫描模型与侧位头颅X光片3D-2D配准的稳定轮廓引导框架，通过构建统一中线牙弓坐标系和表面DRR投影，使用对称双向Chamfer距离优化实现高精度配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于强度的配准方法在真实临床条件下表现不佳，因为头颅X光片存在投影放大、几何畸变、低对比度牙冠等问题，导致配准不稳定或解剖学上不合理的对齐结果。

Method: 首先构建U-Midline Dental Axis建立统一跨牙弓解剖坐标系，然后通过表面DRR公式和Gaussian splatting生成X光片样投影，最后使用对称双向Chamfer距离在层次化粗到细调度下优化2D相似变换。

Result: 在34个专家标注的临床病例上评估，DentalSCR显著降低了标志点误差（特别是后牙区域），在下颌骨上具有更紧密的离散度，在曲线水平上获得低Chamfer距离和可控Hausdorff距离。

Conclusion: DentalSCR能够稳健处理真实世界头颅X光片，提供高保真度、临床可检查的3D-2D对齐，优于传统基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Conclusion: ARC-Chapter通过大规模数据训练和创新的评估方法，在视频分章任务上实现了新的最先进性能，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合基础渲染和图像基残差，实现了高质量的高频细节和视角相关效果渲染，同时保持了存储效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Motivation: 国际生物特征身份证件标准要求严格遵守姿态要求，包括肩部的正面展示，但现有自动化质量评估方法缺乏对此特定属性的定量评估方法。

Method: 使用常见姿态估计框架提供的两个肩部标志点的3D坐标，量化肩部的偏航角和滚转角，开发了肩部姿态评估算法。

Result: 在121张肖像图像数据集上的评估显示，SPE得分与人工标注标签具有强Pearson相关性(r≈0.80)，通过改进的Error-versus-Discard方法分析确认了该指标在识别不合规样本方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法是注册系统中自动化合规检查的可行轻量级工具。

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

Conclusion: LAVA通过语言锚定的视觉对齐，有效地跨域桥接知识，实现稳健的特征聚合和知识重用。

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Motivation: 探索婴儿视觉发育的阶段性特征（低分辨率、颜色退化、时间连续性）如何为机器视觉提供生态优势，以及这种'视觉饮食'策略是否能增强视觉智能的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CATDiet方法，在物体中心视频上训练自监督学习模型，模拟婴儿视觉的三个约束条件：灰度到彩色(C)、模糊到清晰(A)、保持时间连续性(T)。然后提出CombDiet方法，先用CATDiet初始化，再进行标准训练。

Result: 所有CATDiet变体在物体识别任务中表现出增强的鲁棒性，并显示出与生物发育一致的模式，包括类似猕猴V1区突触密度的神经可塑性变化和类似婴儿视觉悬崖反应的行为。CombDiet在物体识别和深度感知任务上优于标准自监督学习。

Conclusion: 早期婴儿视觉体验的发育进程为理解机器中鲁棒视觉智能的出现提供了一个强大的逆向工程框架，表明阶段性视觉发展策略有助于构建更鲁棒的视觉系统。

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的综合实验表明，该对话式方法显著优于仅使用初始描述的基线方法，模块协同集成实现了更高的检索精度和增强的交互体验。

Conclusion: DIR-TIR框架通过多轮对话提供了优于传统单查询方法的控制性和容错性，显著提高了目标图像的命中准确率。

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

Conclusion: 残差-先验设计结合物理约束能够产生空间连贯、物理合理的床地形，适用于领域偏移下的操作制图。

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

Motivation: 解决小农户农场边界分割中高分辨率图像低重访频率的问题，现有Ref-SR方法无法满足大尺度因子需求且会平滑关键特征。

Method: 使用条件潜在扩散模型和大规模多光谱多源地理空间基础模型，在分割感知潜在空间进行超分辨率，绕过像素空间的显式SR任务。

Conclusion: SEED-SR方法能够以前所未有的20倍尺度因子生成分割图，有效结合不同卫星源数据，显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统在泛化能力方面存在局限，无法有效处理未见场景或不同传感器配置。现有基于视觉语言模型的方法要么导致混合系统不一致性问题，要么计算成本过高。

Method: 提出Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD)框架，包含RiskHead插件模块，从视觉语言模型中蒸馏因果风险估计到鸟瞰图特征，生成可解释的风险注意力图。

Conclusion: RSD通过增强BEV表示的风险注意力，使自动驾驶系统更好地模拟人类驾驶行为，在复杂动态环境中具有更好的导航能力。

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: DeCo-VAE通过内容解耦和专用潜在表示学习，有效减少了视频VAE中的冗余，实现了紧凑且高效的视频表示。

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: 该方法能够用更紧凑的潜在表示恢复更多高保真几何细节，解决了多SDF分析中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

Method: 提出三模态框架：RGB分支提取全局视觉不一致性，纹理分支检测细粒度融合伪影，频率分支识别周期性频谱噪声；使用注意力机制进行时间池化和分支融合。

Result: 在Celeb-DF数据集上达到AUC 0.9752、F1-Score 0.9408和准确率0.9208，优于单流基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合提供了对细微伪造的优越鲁棒性，消融实验验证了分支协同作用，Grad-CAM确认了检测焦点。

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLAM-AGS是一个用于计算细胞学的多任务预训练框架，通过联合优化弱监督相似性目标和自监督对比目标，结合自适应梯度手术解决任务梯度冲突，在低见证率下显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算细胞学面临两个主要挑战：实例级标签不可靠且获取成本高，以及见证率极低。需要开发能够在低监督信号下稳定学习的方法。

Method: 提出SLAM-AGS框架，联合优化弱监督相似性目标（在幻灯片负补丁上）和自监督对比目标（在幻灯片正补丁上），使用自适应梯度手术解决任务梯度冲突，并将预训练编码器集成到基于注意力的多实例学习聚合器中。

Result: 在公开的骨髓细胞学数据集上，见证率从10%到0.5%的模拟测试中，SLAM-AGS在袋级F1分数和Top 400阳性细胞检索方面优于其他预训练方法，在低见证率下增益最大。

Conclusion: 解决梯度干扰能够实现稳定的预训练，并在下游任务中获得更好的性能，特别是在低监督信号场景下。

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.

*William Guo,Adaku Uchendu,Ana Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型文本水印技术的鲁棒性和质量保持能力，发现现有水印技术在对抗攻击下易被移除，且会影响文本的写作风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM生成文本的潜在危害，研究者提出了水印技术来嵌入可检测信号。但由于水印技术会降低文本质量且易受对抗攻击，导致LLM创作者对其广泛采用存在抵制。

Method: 通过比较改写和回译（英语→其他语言→英语）攻击来评估多种水印技术的鲁棒性，并使用语言指标来评估水印文本在质量和写作风格方面的保持能力。

Result: 研究结果表明，这些水印技术能够保持语义，但偏离了无水印文本的写作风格，并且容易受到对抗攻击，特别是回译攻击。

Conclusion: 当前的水印技术在对抗攻击下存在脆弱性，特别是在保持文本写作风格方面表现不佳，这阻碍了其在LLM中的广泛应用。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

RT canbe seen as a test-time inference method.

### [98] [Can QE-informed (Re)Translation lead to Error Correction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13884)
*Govardhan Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种无需训练的QE-informed翻译错误修正方法：一种是选择多个LLM生成候选中质量最高的翻译，另一种是基于QE解释替换错误子串。第一种方法在WMT 2025任务中获胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然联合训练QE和APE系统能提升性能，但APE系统存在过度修正问题。本文旨在探索无需训练的简单方法来解决MT输出的错误修正问题。

Method: 提出两种无需训练的方法：1）QE-informed重翻译：从不同LLM生成的多个候选中选择质量最高的翻译；2）类似APE的方法：根据提供的QE解释，指导LLM替换错误子串，并使用条件启发式最小化编辑次数。

Result: 两种方法的Delta COMET得分分别为0.0201和-0.0108，第一种方法在子任务排行榜上获得获胜位置。

Conclusion: 无需训练的QE-informed重翻译方法在翻译错误修正任务中表现优异，优于基于QE解释的编辑方法，为MT质量提升提供了有效的训练自由解决方案。

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在长文本上下文中的"迷失在中间"现象，提出了GM-Extract基准数据集来评估控制变量检索性能，开发了空间和语义检索能力评估指标，并系统评估了不同缓解策略的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在利用长距离上下文时出现"迷失在中间"现象，这给基于检索的LLM应用带来了重大挑战，需要在实际应用环境中研究这一现象的影响。

Method: 提出了GM-Extract基准数据集，设计了空间检索能力（文档指标）和语义检索能力（变量提取指标）两种评估指标，对7-8B参数模型在多文档任务上进行系统评估，并调查了黑盒和白盒两种缓解方法。

Result: 研究发现仅通过改变数据在上下文窗口中的表示方式就能显著改变检索性能，虽然未始终观察到明显的U形曲线，但发现了清晰的性能模式并与困惑度得分相关。缓解策略的效果高度微妙，在某些情况下能成功提升性能，但在其他情况下会产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对LLM长文本上下文利用问题的全面理解，强调了缓解策略在实际应用中的复杂性和情境依赖性，为改进检索型LLM应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过提取结构化解释来理解电商搜索查询中的最高级表达，将查询分解为属性-值提示，并开发高效方法将最高级解释转移到轻量级模型中，以解决LLM直接重排的延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 包含最高级的搜索查询需要在多个维度比较候选结果，需要语言理解和领域知识，但现有方法难以有效处理这类语义复杂的查询。

Method: 开发一个框架，将查询分解为属性-值提示，这些提示与检索过程同时生成，然后通过高效方法将最高级解释转移到轻量级模型中。

Result: 在搜索性能上比基线方法提升10.9个点的MAP，在排名上提升5.9个点的MRR，同时解决了LLM直接重排的高延迟问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为最高级语义在检索系统中的表示和模型间转移提供了见解，在推进语言解释能力的同时解决了实际部署的约束问题。

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

Conclusion: HiEAG框架通过分层证据增强生成，有效提升了多模态上下文外虚假信息检测的性能，实现了令人印象深刻的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多标签情感分类数据集（如GoEmotions）存在严重的类别不平衡问题，这影响了模型性能，特别是对于代表性不足的情感类别。

Method: 通过整合原始GoEmotions数据、使用RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions模型标注的Sentiment140样本以及GPT-4 mini生成的手动标注文本，构建平衡数据集；开发结合FastText嵌入、卷积层、双向LSTM和注意力机制的多标签分类模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多标签情感分类中的类别不平衡问题，证明了平衡数据集和增强模型架构的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Stealth Fine-Tuning的新型攻击方法，通过分段干扰和自生成监督数据，仅用499个样本在3小时内就能有效绕过RVLMs的安全对齐防御，攻击成功率比IDEATOR提高38.52%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现RVLMs暴露的思维链轨迹会引入新的攻击面，其安全对齐机制容易被绕过，需要研究更有效的攻击方法来揭示这些漏洞

Method: 采用分段干扰引发有害推理轨迹，将自生成输出作为监督微调数据，通过轮次加权损失设计实现轻量级、分布一致的微调方法

Result: 在AdvBench和多个通用基准测试中，Stealth Fine-Tuning以低成本高效地绕过了对齐防御，同时保持了模型的通用推理能力

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning是一种低成本、高效的方法，能够有效揭示RVLMs安全对齐的脆弱性，同时保持原始表示分布

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种数据中心的框架，通过生成高质量合成出院摘要来解决ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，显著扩展训练数据分布，提升罕见ICD代码的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本自动ICD编码是医疗NLP的关键任务，但受到诊断代码极端长尾分布的阻碍。数千个罕见和零样本ICD代码在MIMIC-III等数据集中代表性严重不足，导致宏观F1分数较低。

Method: 构建基于真实世界共现模式、ICD描述、同义词、分类法和相似临床笔记的结构化提示，生成90,000个合成笔记覆盖7,902个ICD代码，显著扩展训练分布。在原始和扩展数据集上微调PLM-ICD和GKI-ICD两个最先进的基于Transformer的模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法适度提高了宏观F1分数，同时保持强大的微观F1分数，优于先前的最先进方法。虽然相对于计算成本增益可能显得有限，但结果证明精心设计的合成数据可以增强长尾ICD代码预测的公平性。

Conclusion: 精心制作的合成数据可以有效缓解ICD编码中的长尾分布问题，提升罕见代码的预测性能，增强医疗NLP系统的公平性。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱构建成本高且被视为静态数据库，而基于Transformer的关系抽取方法能够动态生成知识图谱，为自然语言文本的意义表示提供了新可能。

Method: 提出一种回答填空式多项选择题的方法：首先使用关系抽取方法将问题句子转换为关系图，然后在封闭世界假设下与事实正确的知识图谱进行验证，以评估句子的真实性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够正确回答约70%的问题，同时提供程序的可追溯性。研究还发现问题类别对准确率有显著影响。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了动态知识图谱生成和验证，为多项选择题回答提供了可追溯的解决方案，但准确率受问题类型影响较大。

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于符号语言知识的幻觉定位框架，通过分析模型如何处理符号触发器（如修饰词、否定、数字等），揭示了幻觉起源于早期层（2-4层）的符号语义处理崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在遇到符号触发器时仍存在幻觉问题，但缺乏对这些符号幻觉起源的清晰理解，需要系统性地处理这些触发器并在模型内部定位幻觉的出现位置。

Method: 提出基于符号语言和语义知识的定位框架，使用HaluEval和TruthfulQA分析五个模型，重点关注模型如何处理符号触发器，通过注意力方差分析追踪幻觉在所有模型层中的发展。

Result: 符号语言元素的注意力方差在早期层（2-4）爆炸性增长至临界不稳定状态，否定触发灾难性方差水平；尽管模型规模增大，幻觉率仍保持高位（78.3%-83.7%），深层中符号语义触发器的注意力急剧下降。

Conclusion: 幻觉本质上是符号语言处理失败，而非一般生成问题，符号语义知识为理解和定位LLMs中的幻觉机制提供了关键途径。

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

Conclusion: 深度集成大语言模型能有效推进实体链接技术的前沿发展，自验证机制对提升性能至关重要。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets.

*Ahlam Alrehili,Areej Alhothali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ArbESC+系统，这是首个用于阿拉伯语语法错误校正的多系统方法，通过组合多个模型生成修正建议，使用分类器选择最佳修正，在QALB数据集上取得了优于单一模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语具有复杂的形态和句法结构，比其它语言更具挑战性。尽管现代神经模型已有很大改进，但以往方法多使用单一模型，未充分利用多系统组合的潜在优势。

Result: 在QALB-14测试数据上F0.5达到82.63%，在QALB-15 L1数据上达到84.64%，在QALB-15 L2数据上达到65.55%，优于单一模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个整合阿拉伯语语言错误校正的尝试，通过改进现有模型为开发先进阿拉伯语文本处理工具提供了实际步骤，将有益于阿拉伯语用户和研究者。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

Result: 开发了可扩展的数据训练框架和可复用的评估工具，为音乐领域大语言模型的构建提供了系统解决方案。

Conclusion: 本研究通过正确的语料库和训练目标，推动了音乐领域大语言模型的发展，提供了可扩展的数据训练框架和评估工具。

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

TL;DR: 提出Authentic-Dubber模型，通过检索增强的导演-演员交互学习方案，模拟真实电影配音工作流程，提升情感表达能力


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法简化了配音流程，忽略了导演与演员之间的关键互动，而真实工作流程中导演会指导演员内化情感上下文线索

Method: 构建多模态参考片段库，使用基于情感相似性的检索增强策略，开发渐进式图基语音生成方法

Result: 在V2C Animation基准数据集上的主观和客观评估验证了有效性，实现了情感表达能力的全面提升

Conclusion: Authentic-Dubber能够忠实复制真实配音工作流程，在情感表现力方面取得显著改进

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

TL;DR: AfriSpeech-MultiBench是首个针对非洲英语口音的领域特定评估套件，涵盖10多个国家的100多种非洲英语口音和7个应用领域，评估了多种语音识别系统在非洲语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音AI技术快速发展，但目前缺乏针对非洲语言多样性的公开应用特定模型评估，需要填补这一空白以促进包容性语音应用发展。

Method: 构建包含自发和非自发语音对话的综合评估套件，涵盖金融、法律、医疗等7个应用领域，对开源、闭源、单模态ASR和多模态LLM语音识别系统进行基准测试。

Result: 开源ASR在自发语音中表现良好但在嘈杂非母语对话中退化；多模态LLM对口音更鲁棒但处理领域特定命名实体困难；专有模型在清晰语音中准确率高但国别和领域差异显著；非洲英语微调模型在延迟方面具有部署优势。

Conclusion: 该综合基准测试为从业者和研究人员选择适合非洲用例的语音技术提供了依据，有助于为服务不足社区开发包容性语音应用，但多数最先进模型仍存在幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

*Hourun Zhu,Yang Gao,Wenlong Fei,Jiawei Li,Huashan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种熵引导的训练框架来解决大型推理模型在压缩过程中出现的熵冲突问题，能够将推理长度压缩至原始的20%同时保持或提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的链式思维输出过长导致计算成本高和部署性差，现有压缩方法忽视了训练过程中的熵冲突现象，即压缩目标降低熵（缩短推理）与性能目标增加熵（延长推理）之间的冲突。

Method: 采用熵引导的训练框架，当熵下降时引导模型进行简洁推理，当熵上升时在紧凑推理模式下增强探索以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试上的实验表明，该方法将推理长度压缩至原始的20%，同时保持甚至超过基线准确率。

Conclusion: 熵引导训练框架有效解决了推理模型压缩中的熵冲突问题，实现了推理长度的大幅压缩而不损失性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过预测语言化概率分布来增强LLM置信度估计的方法，该方法要求模型考虑答案空间中的所有候选项并仔细分配置信度分数，从而促进深入推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解模型响应的可靠性在应用中至关重要。虽然已有研究关注生成语言化置信度并结合思维链推理，但推理策略如何影响置信度估计仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出预测语言化概率分布的方法，要求LLM考虑答案空间中的所有候选项而不是基于单一猜测，并仔细分配置信度分数以满足分布要求。

Result: 该方法在不同模型和各种任务中均显示出优势，无论答案空间是否已知。即使在强化学习后，其优势仍然保持，且分析表明其推理模式与人类期望一致。

Conclusion: 预测语言化概率分布能有效鼓励深入推理进行置信度估计，该方法具有广泛适用性和稳健性。

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

Result: 评估显示当前模型在表面水平上表现良好，但在深层语法和句法推理方面存在困难，揭示了基于知识的基准高分与真实语言掌握之间的差距。

Conclusion: AraLingBench通过分离和测量基础语言技能，为开发阿拉伯语大语言模型提供了诊断框架，评估代码已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: ConInstruct基准测试评估LLMs在用户指令包含冲突约束时的检测和解决能力，发现专有LLMs冲突检测能力强但很少明确通知用户冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs遵循用户指令的能力，但忽视了指令包含冲突约束的常见情况，LLMs在此类条件下的行为尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入ConInstruct基准测试，专门设计用于评估LLMs检测和解决用户指令中冲突的能力，通过该数据集评估冲突检测性能并分析冲突解决行为。

Result: 专有LLMs冲突检测能力强，开源模型中仅DeepSeek-R1表现类似；DeepSeek-R1和Claude-4.5-Sonnet平均F1分数最高（91.5%和87.3%）；尽管检测能力强，LLMs很少明确通知用户冲突或请求澄清。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在冲突处理方面存在关键缺陷，为未来设计指令遵循型LLMs提供了重要改进方向。

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在预测候选选项时存在标签偏差，现有校准方法忽视了多标记类别标签带来的偏差，特别是标签长度不一致导致的预测不一致问题。

Method: 提出标准化上下文校准(NCC)，在全标签级别对预测进行标准化和校准，有效缓解标签长度偏差，并可扩展到多项选择问答等更广泛任务。

Result: NCC在多个数据集和模型上实现统计显著改进，F1分数最高提升10%；结合上下文学习时，对少样本示例选择敏感性降低，需要更少示例达到竞争性能，产生更可靠的置信度估计。

Conclusion: 缓解全标签偏差对于提升基于LLM方法的性能和鲁棒性至关重要，特别是在类别标签自然包含多个标记的现实应用中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

Method: 构建EduHarm基准包含五个教育场景的安全-不安全指令对；提出三阶段防护框架：安全感知注意力重新对齐、分层安全判断、防御驱动的双路由机制。

Result: 在八种越狱攻击策略上的实验表明TSSF有效增强安全性且避免良性查询的过度拒绝；在三个微调攻击数据集上的评估显示其能持续实现对有害查询的鲁棒防御，同时保持良性微调的效用增益。

Conclusion: TSSF框架能够同时缓解越狱和微调攻击，为教育场景的LLMs提供有效的安全保障，在保持模型效用的同时增强安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

Motivation: 当前LLM智能体的强化学习应用仍处于早期阶段，缺乏专门针对LLM智能体的RL方法探索和灵活可扩展的训练框架。

Method: 首先系统化扩展MDP框架来定义LLM智能体的关键组件，然后提出模块化、灵活且用户友好的Agent-R1训练框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级声明提取在事实核查领域仍面临挑战，现有评估方法关注有限，需要建立可靠的评估框架来比较模型提取和人工标注的声明集。

Method: 研究声明对齐技术，识别最佳对齐和评估方法，通过对齐分数计算声明集相似度，在捷克和斯洛伐克新闻评论数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验结果揭示了当前评估方法在文档级声明提取中的局限性，特别是在处理非正式语言、强本地语境和语言细微差别时的不足。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的评估方法，能够正确捕捉语义相似度并评估声明的关键属性，如原子性、可核查性和去语境化。

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用电子健康记录数据，通过聚类分析识别了15种不同的AKI后临床状态，发现这些状态具有不同的CKD进展风险。大多数患者（75%）在研究期间保持单一状态或仅发生一次状态转变。研究识别了传统和新型CKD风险因素，其影响在不同临床状态中有所差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性肾损伤（AKI）患者发展为慢性肾脏病（CKD）的风险很高，但识别高风险患者仍然具有挑战性。本研究旨在通过动态追踪AKI患者的临床演变来表征AKI向CKD的进展过程。

Method: 使用电子健康记录数据，通过聚类分析从纵向医疗代码和肌酐测量值中提取的患者向量来识别AKI后临床状态。采用多状态模型估计状态间转移概率和CKD进展概率，并通过生存分析识别AKI亚群中的CKD风险因素。

Result: 在20,699名入院时患有AKI的患者中，3,491人（17%）发展为CKD。识别出15种不同的AKI后状态，每种状态具有不同的CKD发展概率。大多数患者（75%）在研究期间保持单一状态或仅发生一次状态转变。识别了传统（如AKI严重程度、糖尿病、高血压等）和新型CKD风险因素，其影响在不同临床状态中有所差异。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种数据驱动的方法来识别高风险AKI患者，为开发早期CKD检测和干预的决策支持工具提供了支持。

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

*Shreya Adrita Banik,Niaz Nafi Rahman,Tahsina Moiukh,Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了人类标注与多种大语言模型（GPT、BERT、RoBERTa、FLAN）在检测新闻媒体政治偏见方面的表现，发现RoBERTa与人类标注最一致，GPT在零样本设置下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP技术已能自动分类政治偏见，但大语言模型与人类判断的一致性程度仍相对未被充分探索和理解。

Method: 构建人工标注的新闻文章数据集，评估标注一致性、偏见极性和模型间一致性，量化人类与模型对偏见感知的差异。

Result: 传统基于Transformer的模型中，RoBERTa与人类标签对齐度最高；生成模型如GPT在零样本设置下与人类标注的总体一致性最强；微调的RoBERTa模型在所有基线中获得最高准确度和最强的人类标注对齐度。

Conclusion: 人类与LLMs在感知政治倾向方面存在系统性差异，需要结合人类可解释性和模型可扩展性的混合评估框架来自动化媒体偏见检测。

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Motivation: 解决传统基于代码和文本的自主科学发现系统在错误修正和实时指导方面的局限性，通过视觉语言模型提供可验证的检查点机制来提升系统的鲁棒性和适应性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型作为评判者，基于动态生成的领域特定评分标准评估图表，使智能体能够实时纠正自身错误并引导探索性数据分析。

Result: 在10个数据驱动发现任务的基准测试中，VLM增强系统达到0.7-0.8的pass@1分数，显著优于仅代码（0.2-0.3）和代码加文本（0.4-0.5）的基线方法，同时提供可审计的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型引导的多智能体系统能够有效提升自主科学发现的性能和可解释性，为自动化数据探索提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

TL;DR: RareSeek R1是一个专门针对罕见病诊断的AI系统，通过领域专业临床语料库和临床验证推理集开发，在多中心电子健康记录和公共基准测试中达到最先进准确率，性能与经验丰富的医生相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病影响全球数亿人，但诊断往往需要多年时间。传统流程将噪声证据提取与下游推理诊断分离，通用/医学大语言模型面临真实世界电子健康记录稀缺、领域知识陈旧和幻觉问题。

Method: 构建大型领域专业临床语料库和临床验证推理集，通过分阶段指令调优、思维链学习和图基础检索开发RareSeek R1。增强检索在叙事与优先变异配对时通过解决歧义和对齐候选机制产生最大收益。

Result: 在多中心电子健康记录叙事和公共基准测试中，RareSeek R1达到最先进准确率，具有稳健的泛化能力和在噪声或重叠表型下的稳定性。人类研究显示性能与经验丰富的医生相当，辅助使用中持续获益。透明推理突出显示决定性非表型证据（中位数23.1%，如影像、干预、功能测试）支撑许多正确诊断。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了叙事优先、知识集成推理范式，缩短诊断历程，实现可审计、临床可转化的决策支持。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明比较性幻觉可以通过贝叶斯推理和噪声通道模型解释，但需要更精确的定量模型来预测幻觉强度并解释未解现象。

Method: 通过统计语言模型与人类行为数据的新颖结合，推导出合理解释的后验概率定量模型，直接预测幻觉强度。

Result: 模型不仅解释了比较性幻觉效应的精细梯度，还解释了之前未解释的代词与完整名词短语主语的影响效应。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持噪声通道理论作为语言处理现象的统一计算层面理论，证明了该理论对比较性幻觉的新颖预测在经验上成立。

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SpatiaLite基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，发现当前先进VLMs主要依赖语言表征，在视觉中心任务上存在显著缺陷，且推理效率低下，并提出了改进的Imagery Driven Framework。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型和视觉语言模型在逻辑推理、问题解决等方面表现出色，但空间推理（包括心理旋转、导航和空间关系理解）仍然是当前先进VLMs的重大挑战。研究者假设想象力（空间状态的内部模拟）是空间世界模型中的主导推理机制。

Method: 引入完全合成的基准测试SpatiaLite，联合测量空间推理准确性和推理效率。通过综合实验分析当前VLMs的空间推理机制，并提出Imagery Driven Framework（IDF）用于数据合成和训练。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：1）先进VLMs主要依赖语言表征进行推理和想象，在需要感知空间关系和3D几何变换的视觉中心任务上存在显著缺陷；2）当前空间推理机制效率严重低下，随着变换复杂度增加，token使用量快速增长；3）IDF框架可以隐式构建对空间推理至关重要的内部世界模型。

Conclusion: 基于SpatiaLite，本研究描绘了先进VLMs的空间推理限制和模式，识别了关键缺陷，并为未来进展提供了信息。IDF框架为改进VLMs的空间推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Conclusion: 成功将反事实概率边界计算方法从马尔可夫模型扩展到半马尔可夫模型，增强了方法在存在混淆关系场景下的适用性。

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态推理中表现出强大能力，但极易受到越狱攻击，特别是在智能交通系统等关键应用中存在严重安全风险。

Method: 构建交通相关有害查询数据集，提出基于图像排版操纵和多轮提示的新型越狱攻击方法，并设计多层响应过滤防御技术。

Conclusion: 智能交通系统中集成的LVLMs面临严重的越狱攻击安全风险，需要有效的防御机制来防止不当响应生成。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

TL;DR: CORGI是一种新的模式匹配算法，针对规则系统中指数级时间和空间复杂度问题，提供二次时间空间保证，避免传统RETE算法中的内存溢出和高延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决规则系统中复杂匹配问题的时间空间约束，特别是在实时AI应用和数据库查询中，避免自动生成的规则导致指数级复杂度问题。

Method: 采用两步法：前向传递构建/维护接地关系图，后向迭代器按需生成匹配，不同于RETE的β内存收集部分匹配的方法。

Result: 在性能评估中，CORGI在简单组合匹配任务上显著优于SOAR和OPS5的RETE实现。

Conclusion: CORGI算法使在线AI系统能够处理自动生成的复杂匹配模式，而无需手动工程约束或面临不可预测的故障模式。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效生成逼真的工作场所危险图像，为训练安全检测模型提供了可行的数据增强方案。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

TL;DR: ALEX是一个轻量级知识编辑框架，通过分层内存架构将知识更新组织成语义簇，将检索复杂度从O(N)降低到O(K+N/C)，显著提高了多跳问答的准确性和推理路径的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应不断变化的信息，现有方法在处理需要多步推理的复杂多跳问题时面临可扩展性和检索效率的挑战。

Method: ALEX采用分层内存架构组织知识更新，包含推理查询合成模块来弥合查询与事实之间的语义差距，以及动态证据裁决引擎执行高效的两阶段检索过程。

Conclusion: ALEX为构建可扩展、高效且准确的知识编辑系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

TL;DR: Syn-STARTS是一个使用LLMs生成分类案例的框架，用于解决大规模伤亡事件中分类数据稀缺的问题，验证了合成数据在开发高性能AI模型中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件中的分类决策至关重要，但现实数据难以收集，因此需要开发能够生成高质量合成数据的方法来支持AI模型的开发和评估。

Method: 开发了Syn-STARTS框架，利用大型语言模型生成分类案例，并与人工整理的TRIAGE开放数据集进行定性比较验证。

Result: Syn-STARTS生成的分类案例在质量上与人工整理的数据集无法区分，且在使用标准START分类方法评估时，LLM在绿色、黄色、红色和黑色类别的准确性表现高度稳定。

Conclusion: 合成数据在开发针对严重和关键医疗情况的高性能AI模型方面具有巨大潜力，能够解决现实数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

Motivation: 解决自适应学习中诊断精确但干预薄弱的问题，避免帮助时机不当或内容不匹配的情况。

Method: 将干预分配形式化为带约束的二元整数规划，包括覆盖度、时间、难度窗口、先决条件和反冗余约束。采用贪婪选择、梯度松弛和混合方法三种求解器。

Conclusion: 该系统构建了一个可追踪和可审计的控制器，闭合了诊断-教学循环，在课堂规模上实现了公平且负载感知的个性化教学。

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

Motivation: 移动应用页面布局设计耗时且需要专业技能，现有设计软件使用门槛高，跨页面协作设计需要额外时间统一标准。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，包含协调器、语义解析器、主布局生成器、模板检索器和递归组件生成器，通过智能体协作完成从用户描述到精细布局的自动化设计。

Result: 在RICO数据集上的实验结果表明，APD-agents达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该工作充分利用了大模型驱动的多智能体系统的自动协作能力，实现了高效的移动应用页面自动化设计。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM方法在视觉语言导航任务中仍与领域专家存在性能差距，且计算成本高、推理延迟大，需要解决LLMs理解真实世界空间关系的不足。

Method: 提出R3双过程思维框架，包含Runner（轻量级专家模型）、Ruminator（多模态LLM推理模块）和Regulator（导航进度监控器），通过三种标准控制思维模式切换。

Result: 在REVERIE基准测试中，SPL和RGSPL分别超过现有最佳方法3.28%和3.30%，显著提升VLN任务处理效果。

Conclusion: R3框架有效整合了LLMs的泛化能力和VLN专业知识的优势，在零样本情况下实现了视觉语言导航任务的显著性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 测试大型语言模型在时间顺序理解任务上的表现，包括时间排序、条件排序和时代错误检测，发现模型在全局一致性时间线方面存在困难，但增加推理预算可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否真正理解时间顺序，这对金融和经济领域的应用至关重要，因为这些领域经常需要避免前瞻性偏差。

Method: 设计了一系列时间顺序任务，包括时间排序、条件排序（先过滤后排序）和时代错误检测，测试了GPT-4.1、Claude-3.7 Sonnet（有/无扩展思维）和GPT-5在不同推理努力设置下的表现。

Result: 随着序列长度增加，精确匹配率急剧下降，但排名相关性保持较高；条件排序中的失败主要来自过滤步骤；时代错误检测是最容易的任务。GPT-5在中等/高推理努力下在所有长度上实现完美排序和条件排序。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在时间顺序任务上存在局限性，但分配明确的推理预算有助于改善性能，这对LLMs在金融领域的实时应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

TL;DR: 本文提出两阶段架构来减少Whisper模型的幻觉错误：第一阶段通过自适应层注意力增强编码器鲁棒性，第二阶段使用多目标知识蒸馏框架抑制幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型在噪声条件下经常出现幻觉错误，而现有方法主要关注音频预处理或转录后处理，对模型本身的修改研究较少。

Method: 1. 自适应层注意力(ALA)：通过层间相关性分析将编码器层分组，使用可学习多头注意力融合块表示；2. 多目标知识蒸馏(KD)：在噪声音频上训练学生模型，使其语义和注意力分布与处理干净输入的教师模型对齐。

Result: 在噪声语音基准测试中显著减少了幻觉和词错误率，同时保持了干净语音上的性能。

Conclusion: ALA和KD为在真实世界噪声条件下提高Whisper可靠性提供了有原则的策略。

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PathMind始终优于竞争基线，特别是在复杂推理任务上，通过识别基本推理路径，使用更少的输入token实现更好的性能。

Conclusion: PathMind通过选择性引导LLMs使用重要推理路径，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在知识图谱推理任务中实现了更忠实、可解释且高效的推理性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 本文通过重新表述和扰动经典CSPLib问题来测试LLMs的模型生成能力，发现虽然LLMs能生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，表明其理解浅层且对措辞敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLMs自动生成优化和约束编程模型的能力是否源于数据污染而非真正推理，因为许多标准CP问题可能已包含在训练数据中。

Method: 系统性地重新表述和扰动一组知名CSPLib问题，保持结构不变但修改上下文并引入误导元素，然后比较三个代表性LLMs在原始和修改描述下生成的模型。

Result: LLMs能生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，显示出浅层理解和对措辞的敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动生成优化模型方面的成功可能更多源于数据污染而非真正的推理能力，其性能对问题的具体表述高度敏感。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的对齐决策往往忽视人类社会的多样性，本研究旨在探究如何通过纳入多元价值观来改进LLM的对齐过程，确保模型行为既安全又能公平代表不同社会群体。

Method: 收集了来自美国和德国参与者的27,375个评分，评估LLM响应在毒性、情感意识、敏感性、刻板印象偏见和帮助性五个维度上的表现。使用不同社会群体的偏好对多个大型语言模型和推理模型进行微调，同时改变评分尺度、分歧处理方法和优化技术。

Result: 发现了系统性的人口统计学效应：男性参与者对毒性的评分比女性低18%；保守派和黑人参与者对情感意识的评分分别比自由派和白人参与者高27.9%和44%。技术设计选择显示强烈影响：保留评分者分歧比多数投票实现约53%更大的毒性减少；5点量表比二元格式产生约22%更多的减少；DPO在多值优化中始终优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 这些发现为解决关键问题提供了初步步骤：对齐过程应如何平衡专家驱动和用户驱动的信号，以确保安全性和公平代表性。研究强调了在LLM对齐中考虑社会多样性和技术设计参数的重要性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.
