Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统性评估方法来分析和量化基于修复的说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题，通过三种互补测试设置和衍生指标来建立更可靠的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持视频细节的同时修改嘴唇运动，但存在嘴唇泄漏问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，传统指标难以检测此问题。

Method: 提出系统性评估框架，包括三种测试设置：静音输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对、匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入嘴唇同步差异和基于静音音频的嘴唇同步得分等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效分析和量化嘴唇泄漏问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响，为参考设计提供见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是模型无关的，为说话人脸生成领域的未来研究建立了更可靠的评估基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个多无人机监控数据集和深度学习框架，用于复杂环境下的行人跟踪，解决了动态相机位置和遮挡问题，在挑战性场景中保持约90%的检测跟踪准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动态相机位置和复杂遮挡问题，需要开发能够适应动态无人机监控环境的解决方案。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个无人机同步视频）和深度学习框架，包括实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图多视图特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境中保持约90%检测跟踪准确率，成功跟踪约80%轨迹，迁移学习显示强泛化能力，相机丢失实验显示性能优雅下降。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视图监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在实际部署中的实用性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [4] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库而非任务特定的子内存库，通过最近邻匹配机制实现最先进的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别的子内存库，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出统一内存库框架，在固定大小的核心集中增量更新嵌入，通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测精度的同时提高了灵活性和可扩展性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [5] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)
*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，旨在解决传感器噪声和及时可靠预测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中事故预测至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：传感器输入因天气、运动模糊或硬件限制而噪声或退化；需要在及时性和可靠性之间平衡，既要早期预警又要抑制误报。

Method: 采用扩散模块通过迭代细化重建噪声鲁棒的图像和物体特征，保留关键运动和交互线索；同时使用actor-critic架构进行长期时间推理和时间加权奖励，确定最佳预警时机。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（DAD、CCD、A3D）上实现了最先进的准确性和显著的平均事故时间增益，在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类对齐的预测，展示了其在现实世界安全关键部署中的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [6] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名适配器模块从视频特征中移除私人信息，同时保持任务实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在共享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），现有像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型且不适用于视频基础模型。

Method: 设计轻量级匿名适配器模块（AAM），可即插即用到冻结的视频编码器，采用三个新训练目标：片段级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失。

Result: 在多个下游任务中显著减少35%的隐私泄露，同时保持接近基线的实用性性能，并有效减轻动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时保持模型实用性，并促进更公平的视频理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优缩放策略存在差异，生成任务需要数据量以3-5倍更快的速度增长。随着分辨率增加，模型大小必须比数据量增长更快，计算能力是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，为未来大规模视觉模型发展提供指导。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件在32x32分辨率上训练一系列Transformer模型，计算预算高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和基于Fr'echet距离的生成质量。

Result: 发现最优缩放策略高度依赖具体任务，在固定分辨率下，生成任务的最优设置需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长。随着分辨率增加，模型大小必须比数据量增长更快。计算能力是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果预测，随着计算能力每年增长4-5倍，未来五年内实现逐像素图像建模是可行的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究使用扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth）生成平衡训练数据，以解决图像分类中的群体偏见问题。通过聚类和分组训练DreamBooth模型，生成更准确的群体代表性图像，在多个基准测试中优于原始Stable Diffusion，并与SOTA去偏技术性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统因训练数据中群体分布不均而存在偏见，如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据，但难以保持原始数据分布。本文旨在通过扩散模型微调技术生成更准确的群体代表性图像。

Method: 探索多种扩散微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth），直接从训练样本学习以生成更准确的群体代表性图像。为防止单个DreamBooth模型被组内变异淹没，采用组内图像聚类技术，为每个聚类训练一个DreamBooth模型。使用这些模型生成群体平衡数据进行预训练，然后在真实数据上微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与SOTA去偏技术（如Group-DRO）性能相当，且随着数据集偏见严重程度增加，性能超越这些技术。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成平衡训练数据，缓解图像分类中的群体偏见问题，特别是在偏见严重的数据集上表现优异，为去偏提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的旋转不变学习方法，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因感受野受限导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题，能够在保持旋转不变性的同时保留全局姿态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变学习方法使用手工设计的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然对任意旋转具有鲁棒性，但会丢失全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间位置不同的结构。这种限制源于感受野受限导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题。

Method: 1. 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点(阴影)，将局部RI描述符与全局姿态信息结合；2. 设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，将SiPF集成到特征聚合过程中；3. 基于Bingham分布设计任务自适应的阴影定位模块，动态学习最优全局旋转。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间区分能力的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提出的SiPF和RIAttnConv能够有效解决现有RI方法的局限性，在保持旋转不变性的同时增强对几何相似但空间不同结构的区分能力，为3D点云处理提供了更强大的旋转不变学习框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications. The source code of the proposed approach can be found at the GitHub repository of Indiana University Division of Computational Pathology: https://github.com/IUCompPath/brats-path-2024-enet.

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

### [14] [LLM-Guided Probabilistic Fusion for Label-Efficient Document Layout Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08903)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出融合视觉预测与LLM结构先验的半监督文档布局理解框架，通过概率加权提升伪标签质量，在轻量级和预训练模型上均取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档布局理解仍然需要大量标注数据，现有半监督方法未能充分利用文本结构信息，需要结合LLM的结构先验知识来提升性能。

Method: 使用OCR-LLM流水线推断文档层次区域，通过逆方差融合将教师检测器输出与LLM结构先验结合生成精炼伪标签，采用实例自适应门控机制。

Result: 在PubLayNet数据集上，轻量级SwiftFormer仅用5%标签达到88.2±0.3 AP；与LayoutLMv3结合达到89.7±0.4 AP，超越标准半监督学习，匹配需要大规模预训练的UDOP。

Conclusion: LLM结构先验与视觉模型互补，自适应门控机制提升性能，开源LLM可实现隐私保护部署，LLM提供语义消歧能力超越简单文本启发式方法。

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Method: 基于服装光谱反射特性的光谱方法，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现HitoMi-Cam系统，无需GPU支持。

Result: 处理速度达23.2 fps（253x190像素），在模拟搜救场景中平均精度达93.5%，远超对比CNN模型的最佳精度53.8%，误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是CNN检测器的替代品，而是在特定条件下（如形状不可预测的灾难救援环境）的补充工具，光谱人员检测是边缘设备实时操作的可行选择。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过负实体抑制机制显著提升了模型的跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Method: 提出SPEED-Q框架：1）分阶段敏感度自适应机制协调不同模态性能；2）蒸馏增强量化策略稳定训练过程并减少数据依赖。

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的双向参考协调视频压缩方法BRHVC，通过双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合技术，优化双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了传统编码方法VTM-RA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩（NBVC）相比P帧压缩研究较少，但NBVC可以利用双向参考帧获得更好的压缩性能。然而，其分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层级，造成两个参考帧的贡献不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛（BMC）和双向上下文融合（BCF）。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更大尺度的精确运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，BRHVC优于之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超越了传统编码方法VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考，为神经B帧视频压缩提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Motivation: 分形生成模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。为了解决这一问题，需要引入能够量化结构复杂性的方法。

Method: 1. 提出可学习的HD估计方法，直接从图像嵌入预测HD；2. 采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动的调度策略；3. 在推理阶段使用HD引导的拒绝采样来选择几何结构更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGM实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了可比的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个将HD引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM的发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Conclusion: AuthSig成功地将认证信息绑定到签名图像中，为静态电子签名提供了可靠的安全验证解决方案。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Result: 在零样本检测中表现出色，显著缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景中表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负提示成为推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Conclusion: Owl框架通过建模幻觉的因果过程并动态调整模态注意力，有效缓解了大型视觉语言模型中的目标幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的视觉语言理解能力。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Existing unsupervised image alignment methods exhibit limited accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a dense cross-scale image alignment model. It takes into account the correlations between cross-scale features to decrease the alignment difficulty. Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且可控性有限。需要开发能够跨领域泛化、支持自然语言动作控制的世界模型。

Method: 采用生成式潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态骨干（支持语言动作条件化）和视频扩散解码器（重建感知细节和时间连贯的视觉观察）。

Result: 在大规模视频-动作对数据集上训练，PAN在动作条件化世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN朝着通用世界模型迈出了一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为方向正交对抗攻击（DOC）的新方法，通过引入正交梯度方向和动量更新来增强对抗攻击的多样性和覆盖范围，从而提高视觉语言预训练模型在测试时的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时对抗攻击方法（如TTC）由于对抗攻击和对抗攻击之间的优化目标存在根本差异，仅基于对抗输入的梯度生成对抗攻击，导致搜索空间受限，攻击多样性不足，无法完全中和广泛的扰动。

Method: 提出方向正交对抗攻击（DOC），通过结合正交梯度方向和基于动量的更新来增强对抗攻击优化，扩展对抗攻击空间的探索，增加扰动的多样性。同时提出基于平均余弦相似度的方向敏感度评分，通过改进示例区分度和自适应调节对抗攻击强度来提升DOC效果。

Result: 在16个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DOC在各种攻击下提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 增强对抗攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御中的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过正交梯度方向和动量更新有效实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了Kuzushiji文档处理中噪声挑战的空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准和基线方法。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: DBINDS通过分析潜在空间动态而非像素特征，有效解决了AI生成视频检测中的跨生成器泛化问题，为内容安全提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Method: 构建DermBench基准，包含4000个真实世界皮肤病图像与专家认证的诊断叙述，使用基于LLM的评分器在临床维度上评估候选叙述；训练无参考的多模态评估器DermEval，给定图像和生成叙述，输出结构化批评和评分。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可靠的多模态LLM诊断能力和可信度测量，支持细粒度分析和模型局限性识别。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现幻觉问题，特别是在对象存在性、属性和关系方面的错误，这影响了它们的可靠性。

Method: TACO将响应分解为原子查询，通过改写减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型精炼答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）和两个MLLM上的实验表明，TACO持续优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少系统偏差并改善置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效增强了多模态大语言模型的忠实度，证明了其在减轻幻觉方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽视了跨模态表示的潜力。本文探索将CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为知识蒸馏的补充监督源。

Method: 提出RichKD框架，融合传统教师模型的logits和特征与CLIP的logits和特征，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，同时捕捉数据集特定的视觉线索和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中持续优于现有基线方法，产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例，并在分布偏移和输入损坏下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 尽管方法简单，RichKD通过融合CLIP的跨模态知识有效提升了知识蒸馏性能，改善了类间一致性和蒸馏质量，证明了视觉-语言知识作为补充监督源的价值。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

TL;DR: Flora是一个零样本骨架动作识别方法，通过灵活的邻居感知语义调整和开放形式分布感知流分类器，解决了现有方法中的点对点对齐脆弱性和分类器决策边界僵化问题。


<details>

Conclusion: Flora方法通过创新的语义调整和流分类器设计，有效解决了零样本骨架动作识别中的关键挑战，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OUGS框架，通过基于3D高斯原语物理参数的显式不确定性建模，结合语义分割实现对象感知的主动重建，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中特定对象重建的效率和质量。

Conclusion: OUGS框架通过物理基础的不确定性建模和对象感知的视图选择策略，有效解决了复杂场景中特定对象高效重建的挑战，为3DGS在对象中心任务中的应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Result: 仅在合成数据上训练，模型在基准测试中达到平均平移误差2.65毫米和旋转误差0.19弧度，在真实患者数据上显示出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现了鲁棒、域不变的定位，新基准数据集为视觉支气管镜导航的标准化进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Conclusion: 本研究实现了在具有挑战性的高密度美式足球场景中鲁棒的检测与跟踪，解决了传统方法在此类场景中表现不足的问题。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理和时间想象力，成功解决了3D人体姿态估计中的模糊运动和泛化问题，在多个数据集上验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法未能充分个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM间的复杂交互关系，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、噪声大、格式不一致，限制了仅依赖用户特定数据的方法效果。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点类型的异构图，通过定制化消息传递机制，在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少样本数据学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter始终优于强基线方法，准确率提高0.9%到21.6%，AUC提高0.006到0.309。更重要的是，仅使用少样本数据即可适应新用户和演化偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异构图表示和消息传递机制，有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少样本场景下实现了卓越的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个在对抗性提示下测试大语言模型事实保真度的框架，通过让LLM生成和验证真假陈述来测试其对抗自身生成谎言的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题严重阻碍了大语言模型在高风险领域的实际部署，需要测试其在对抗性提示下的事实保真度。

Method: 三步骤框架：1) LLM生成与特定封闭领域一致的真假陈述；2) LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3) 测试LLM对抗自身生成谎言的鲁棒性。

Result: 在电影和小说两个封闭领域的测试显示，Claude表现出强韧性，GPT和Grok中等韧性，Gemini和DeepSeek弱韧性。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多用户使用LLM进行信息检索，这些发现敲响了警钟，表明LLM在对抗性提示下存在事实保真度风险。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

TL;DR: 该研究提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用同一模型生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入，验证LLM安全防护的漏洞。实验显示在零样本和少样本条件下分别达到最高33%和41%的越狱成功率，并发现自动评估会高估52%的越狱成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御假设攻击者来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。研究旨在验证LLM安全防护在自我攻击场景下的脆弱性。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM场景，使用同一模型生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo、LLaMA3-8B-instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型上进行实验，采用基于前缀的自动评估和人工评估。

Result: 在零样本条件下最高达到52%转换成功率和33%越狱成功率，少样本条件下最高达到65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率。自动评估平均高估52%的越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法证明是有效的攻击场景，表明需要重新考虑防护栏设计并建立更稳健的评估方法，自动评估单独使用不足以准确判定有害性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个结合检索增强生成(RAG)和领域知识库的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例材料，解决了手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏专业知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉内容，需要大量专家修订。

Method: 原型化了一个多模型RAG系统，整合了精选领域知识与工程化提示模板，支持五个商业和开源大语言模型，设计了七个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证展示了RAG增强生成儿科言语语言病理学案例的技术可行性。商业模型显示出边际质量优势，但开源替代方案达到了可接受的性能，表明隐私保护机构部署的潜力。

Conclusion: 整合精选知识库能够生成符合专业指南的内容。在教育和研究实施前需要进行专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估的广泛验证。未来应用可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思训练。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式化方法扩展到孟加拉语，重新评估其在减少语言官僚主义方面的有效性，并检验先前研究声称的效果。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc框架开发孟加拉语的形式化表示，应用于英-孟翻译任务，分析其处理结构变化的能力。

Result: 研究发现DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言处理良好，但由于两种语言的结构差异而面临限制，即使在相对简单的句子中也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc在翻译任务中存在约束，与先前声称的效果存在分歧，这突显了框架的局限性并为未来改进提供了空间。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

Conclusion: 通过元学习方法集成多个大语言模型可以显著提升急诊医学诊断准确率，超级学习器能够利用各模型训练数据集的集体知识优势。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Motivation: 传统监督微调在领域专业化时资源消耗大且容易导致灾难性遗忘，需要更高效的数据选择方法来提升微调效率。

Method: 通过分析初步训练阶段的梯度，利用梯度幅值和统计分布设计自引导标准，优先选择对模型学习贡献最大的训练样本。

Result: 在医学、法律、金融等多个领域的实验中，使用仅5%的GrADS选择数据就能超越全数据集微调，50%数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS方法能够高效选择代表性样本，显著提升LLMs领域专业化微调的效率和效果，同时有效控制灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者自述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在提取七个认知类别方面达到最高F1分数。


<details>

Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者在日常生活中描述认知体验的方式，可以为疾病相关的认知和情感变化提供宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别如思维和社交互动方面表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 由于复杂认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠特性，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性。但通过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统通常分别开发任务导向对话和闲聊功能，但现实对话中这两种模式会自然过渡。为了填补这一空白，需要开发能够处理模式转换的统一对话系统。

Method: 提出TACT数据集，包含结构多样化的集成模式流，支持用户和智能体驱动的模式切换。使用直接偏好优化(DPO)对TACT训练的模型进行优化。

Result: 在TACT上训练的模型在意图检测和模式转换处理方面优于基线模型。应用DPO后达到75.74%的联合模式-意图准确率，在人类评估中对GPT-4o的胜率达到70.1%。

Conclusion: 将结构多样化的数据与DPO相结合可以提升响应质量和转换控制能力，为开发更具主动性和转换意识的对话智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但经常产生幻觉内容，影响了事实可靠性，需要解决这一问题来增强LLM输出的可信度。

Method: 采用推理增强范式，将过程明确分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段来识别和精炼无支持的主张；使用最小任务路由提示实现跨领域的零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识源或监督检测器。

Result: 在五个代表性任务（问答、对话、摘要、数学文字问题和矛盾检测）上的实验结果表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean展示了在现实应用中增强LLM输出可信度的潜力，为改善大语言模型的事实可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Conclusion: TiDAR成功解决了扩散模型和自回归模型之间的权衡问题，实现了高质量和高吞吐量的统一，是首个在保持自回归模型质量的同时显著提升生成速度的架构。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

*Longfei Zuo,Barbara Plank,Siyao Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EVADE框架，利用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测自然语言推理任务中的标注错误，相比传统人工两轮标注方法更高效且能提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，人类标注变异使得难以区分标注错误与合理变体，而现有VARIERR框架需要两轮人工标注，成本高且可能限制合理标签或解释的覆盖范围。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，使用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误，通过分布比较、验证重叠和微调影响三个维度全面比较人工与LLM检测的错误。

Result: LLM验证使生成的解释分布更接近人工标注，从训练数据中移除LLM检测的错误比移除人工检测的错误在模型微调性能上提升更明显。

Conclusion: LLM验证具有规模化错误检测的潜力，能减少人工工作量，同时在标签变异情况下提升数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，也没有系统的方法来交织隐式和显式推理。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，在潜在表示上执行迭代更新，实现扩展隐式推理；使用渐进对齐目标和结构化注释保持潜在与文本推理的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在所有基准测试中始终超越先前方法，达到潜在推理方法中的最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker桥接了迭代计算和潜在推理，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于轨迹的情感支持评估框架，从静态对话评估转向动态长期评估，通过构建大规模基准和因果调整的情感估计来全面评估LLMs的长期情感支持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估主要依赖短对话和静态快照，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性，需要更贴近真实场景的评估方法。

Method: 构建包含328个情感情境和1152个干扰事件的大规模基准，约束模型使用验证过的情绪调节策略，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情感估计。

Result: 提出了三个轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）来捕捉用户情感动态，通过对多样化LLMs的广泛评估揭示了情感支持能力的显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架能够全面评估LLMs的长期情感支持性能，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解，证明了轨迹评估在情感支持领域的重要性。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了流式语音识别中的上下文截断问题，在安多藏语识别任务上取得了显著性能提升和延迟优化。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估中间推理步骤，有效提升了检索增强生成在多步推理场景中的性能，为复杂推理任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回复方面达到中低人类水平，但在共情维度表现不足，且评估标准与人类存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖单维度评估LLMs的幽默能力，本文认为需要多维度理解幽默，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 扩展Oogiri数据集，使用LLMs生成回复，并人工标注六个维度的5分制评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性和整体趣味性。

Result: LLMs生成回复能力介于中低人类水平之间，但共情能力明显不足；人类评估优先考虑共情性，而LLMs评估优先考虑新颖性。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默评估方面与人类存在根本差异，释放标注语料库以促进开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Motivation: Transformer模型中的旋转位置编码(RoPE)存在固有的长度外推限制，导致注意力下沉现象，影响模型在长上下文中的表现。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，提出基于截断矩阵熵的DoPE方法检测异常频率带，并使用无参数高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现稳健外推。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务上的实验表明，DoPE在扩展到64K tokens的长上下文中显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 对位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Motivation: 当前工具学习受到静态合成数据流程的限制，数据生成和模型训练作为两个分离的非交互过程，无法自适应关注模型的具体弱点，且允许噪声标签持续存在，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool通过三个协同模块迭代优化数据和模型：1) 贪婪能力探测诊断模型的掌握和失败能力；2) 判断引导标签验证使用开源判断模型查找并纠正标注错误；3) 错误驱动数据扩展基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。

Conclusion: 闭环自优化数据流程可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，消除了对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格作为长文本往往导致错误答案，因为大多数LLM无法固有地捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算给定问题与单个单元格的相似度来估计表头，然后选择最相关行和列交集的单元格作为答案。语言模型通过对比学习在小型问题-表头对数据集上进行训练以提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LLM在表格问答中的结构理解问题，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来进一步提升性能并缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对先前研究提出的sequentiality度量方法存在主题选择混淆问题且缺乏真实流度验证的批评，本文旨在实证验证仅使用上下文术语作为更概念有效和可解释的替代方案。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的论文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较上下文版本的sequentiality与人类评估的语篇特征对齐度，并与零样本提示的LLM预测进行对比。

Result: 上下文版本的sequentiality与人类评估的组织性和连贯性特征更一致；虽然零样本LLM预测特征分数更准确，但上下文度量与标准语言特征结合时比仅基于主题和原始sequentiality公式增加更多预测价值，甚至优于零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动作文评分和相关NLP任务，突显了显式建模句子到句子流度的价值。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统的子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，而本文探索在训练过程中动态优化子词分割的学习动态，特别是研究子词在预训练和微调过程中如何演化。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架，支持预训练和微调，并在三种形态类型不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)上进行训练，从语言学角度分析子词动态变化。

Result: 识别了子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词为低资源形态复杂语言改进了文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习的子词分割为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了一种有前景的方法，能够改善文本生成和跨语言迁移性能。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

TL;DR: 提出了C³TG框架，通过两阶段方法实现细粒度多维度文本属性控制，无需模型架构修改或大量微调


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以精确控制多个文本属性，在属性冲突时缺乏协调机制，且没有在控制生成流程中融入迭代优化过程

Method: 两阶段框架：生成阶段使用17个属性分类器配合加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段通过能量函数结合分类器分数和惩罚项，利用迭代反馈解决属性冲突

Result: 在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低了毒性

Conclusion: C³TG是无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，但现有LLM训练数据集将不同个人品味视为整体，需要开发能够适应每个用户偏好的个性化创意写作LLM。

Method: 构建LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读偏好数据，包括自述偏好和对100对短创意写作文本的标注偏好；使用transformer编码器进行微调建模偏好；采用LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析偏好差异。

Result: 1) 人们在创意写作偏好上存在分歧；2) 微调transformer编码器在建模个人和群体实际偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3) 自述偏好在建模实际偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础，展示了建模个人创意写作偏好的可行性，并揭示了自述偏好与实际偏好之间的差异。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并创建了新的高棉语极性数据集，模型和数据集已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理变长序列输入（如自然语言句子）时性能不佳，需要适应输入特性的动态删除机制。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，采用可调节删除率，基于输入属性动态调整，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到变率删除场景。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中值基数相比最先进方法提升高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态删除率机制有效提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准测试的结果无法充分区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更严格的评估基准来测试模型的深度推理能力。

Method: 构建mmJEE-Eval基准测试，包含1460个来自JEE Advanced考试（2019-2025）的物理、化学和数学问题，评估17个最先进模型，并进行系统性消融实验。

Result: 前沿VLM在2025年问题上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅37-45%；当增加元认知推理负荷时，GPT-5仅修复5.2%错误；基准测试难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准测试能够有效区分优越的训练和推理方法，揭示了现有模型在深度科学推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Motivation: 测试时扩展能提升大语言模型的推理性能，但计算成本高。现有动态自一致性方法虽然减少了令牌消耗，但仍受限于顺序请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用快速系统1计算查询的答案熵，评估样本扩展潜力，在系统2下进行动态自一致性推理，实现并行生成。

Result: 相比现有方法，令牌消耗减少高达47%，推理延迟降低43%，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC通过系统1和系统2的协同工作，在保持性能的同时显著提高了令牌效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Motivation: 现有的SPARQL到Cypher转换解决方案存在局限性，需要RDF图或外部工具支持。本文旨在开发一个纯粹基于规则的轻量级解析器，无需依赖外部资源即可实现高效转换。

Method: S2CLite采用基于传统编程语言编译器的纯规则方法，不依赖RDF图或外部工具，实现了SPARQL到Cypher的轻量级转换。

Result: 在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验表明，S2CLite在Spider4SPARQL上的总解析准确率达到77.8%，显著优于S2CTrans的44.2%。在执行准确率方面，在两者都能解析的查询子集上达到96.6%，比S2CTrans高出7.3%。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试上的大量实验表明，AMaPO不仅实现了更好的排序准确性和优越的下游对齐性能，而且针对性分析确认它成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过解决过拟合-欠拟合困境，为离线偏好优化提供了一种简单而有效的改进方法，显著提升了语言模型对齐的效果。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Motivation: 心理咨询需求增长与有限服务资源之间的不匹配，促使研究将大语言模型应用于该领域，但缺乏专业、统一的评估基准。现有方法存在客户模拟不专业、评估形式静态、指标单一等问题。

Method: 基于真实心理咨询案例构建多样化客户档案，依据专家指南进行模拟，建立动态交互式自动基准测试CARE-Bench，采用基于成熟心理量表的多维度性能评估方法。

Result: 评估了多个通用大语言模型和专业咨询模型，揭示了它们当前的局限性。通过与心理学家合作，详细分析了模型在与不同类型客户互动时失败的原因。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，CARE-Bench能够有效评估模型处理多样化复杂客户的能力。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，生成完整的ASP程序来代表和解决目标问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多不熟悉编程语言的人需要与代码交互，需要一种方法让非程序员能够使用自然语言描述逻辑问题并自动生成ASP程序。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后从简化语言解析AMR图，系统性地生成ASP约束，最小化LLM的作用。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，展示了该方法的能力。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的重大第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Motivation: ARC-AGI是人类轻松解决但对最先进AI系统极其困难的基准测试，受神经科学到心理学的人类智能建模方法启发，需要开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 使用向量符号代数进行神经符号方法，通过面向对象的程序合成，利用VSA表示抽象对象、指导解决方案搜索并实现样本高效的神经学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，在ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%；在Sort-of-ARC上得分94.5%，在1D-ARC上得分83.1%，以极小计算成本超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，为人工智能通用智能提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

TL;DR: 本文提出单向认知优化（UCO）方法，通过多轮交互强化学习解决LLM作为智能导师时的两个关键挑战：无法区分学生是否真正理解，以及无法感知学生认知状态变化。UCO使用进展奖励和支架奖励来评估学生认知进步并识别最近发展区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教育应用中存在局限：监督微调只能学习表面教学模式，强化学习方法仅基于学生输出正确性评估教学效果，无法区分学生是否真正理解，也无法动态感知学生认知状态变化来调整教学策略。

Method: 提出单向认知优化（UCO）方法，采用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进展奖励捕捉学生认知进步，评估学生是否从困惑转向理解；支架奖励动态识别每个学生的最近发展区（ZPD），鼓励教师在此区域内保持有效教学。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模的基线模型，并达到与先进闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过进展奖励和支架奖励有效解决了LLM作为智能导师时的关键挑战，实现了对学生认知状态的动态感知和教学策略的自适应调整，在教育应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过渐进式搜索增强LLM推理能力的有效架构特征，结构化多智能体管道能够显著提升推理质量。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Conclusion: Argus框架有效且高效地增强了自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著提高了驾驶性能并减少了安全违规。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，降低了工业应用的专业知识和数据壁垒。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练简洁性奖励模型（CRM）的管道，通过新颖的简洁性奖励函数（CRF）解决大型推理模型中的过度思考问题，在保持准确性的同时显著减少响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1）经常生成包含冗余推理步骤的冗长响应（过度思考现象），这会显著增加计算成本。现有的长度惩罚方法存在长度崩溃和训练崩溃问题。

Method: 提出训练简洁性奖励模型（CRM）的管道来评估推理路径的简洁性，并引入具有结果奖励和简洁性评分显式依赖关系的简洁性奖励函数（CRF）。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应token长度减少，并且在Llama和Mistral等其他LLM上也有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论证明和实验验证，能够有效提升推理模型的效率和准确性，解决了过度思考问题，同时提供了公开的代码和数据集供复现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个双层可靠性监控框架，用于解决智能AI系统在运行时的可靠性不足问题，包括异常输入检测和AI透明度层，为人类操作员提供决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能AI系统虽然具有自主性优势，但在高风险领域应用时存在可靠性不足的问题，需要开发缓解技术来降低运行时的风险。

Method: 提出双层可靠性监控框架：第一层用于检测异常输入，第二层通过AI透明度揭示内部操作，为人类操作员提供决策支持。

Result: 该框架能够识别潜在不可靠的输出，使操作员能够及时干预，为开发运行时可靠性缓解技术奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 双层监控框架为解决智能AI系统运行时的可靠性挑战提供了有效方法，特别适用于高风险领域的应用场景。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse是一个用于处理不规则临床时间序列的框架，通过MuFuse模块使用乘法融合方式结合特征身份和数值嵌入，解决了传统加法融合在捕捉特征间高阶依赖关系方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等特点。现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征身份和数值嵌入，限制了捕捉数值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse（乘法嵌入融合）模块，通过乘法调制融合数值和特征嵌入，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模特征间的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上持续优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可泛化的方法，乘法融合机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

TL;DR: 本文提出HyperD框架，通过解耦交通数据的周期性和残差分量来提升预测精度，解决复杂空间依赖和多尺度周期模式与不规则波动的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临两个关键挑战：复杂的空间依赖关系以及多尺度周期模式与不规则波动的共存。现有方法难以有效处理这些复杂特征。

Method: 提出HyperD框架，将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差分量。周期性分量使用混合周期表示模块处理，残差分量使用频率感知残差表示模块在频域建模。引入双视图对齐损失确保语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，同时在干扰下具有更好的鲁棒性和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和残差分量，有效解决了交通预测中的复杂空间依赖和多尺度模式问题，为智能交通系统提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培养"的范式转变，将价值观对齐融入模型开发全过程，通过重新设计训练语料库来实现早期价值观承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易被误导且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大语言模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练范式。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库的四个关键组件：以第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、以及搭建训练数据排序的脚手架。

Result: 预期这种训练语料库的重新设计将使模型从第一个训练token开始就承诺价值观，使得知识、技能和价值观内在难以分离。

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类任务的生态系统中，这种从模型训练到模型培养的范式转变是至关重要的需求。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和大型语言模型正在重塑科学，但定性研究领域被忽视。研究人员对采用AI持犹豫态度，只能依赖通用工具如ChatGPT进行访谈解释、数据标注和主题建模，但这些系统存在偏见、不透明、不可复现和隐私风险等局限。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门针对定性研究的AI系统，以弥补当前AI在定量方法方面的进步与定性维度整合不足之间的关键差距，这对于意义建构和全面科学理解至关重要。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿LLM在端到端规划任务中的推理能力，并与传统规划器LAMA进行比较，了解LLM在纯推理任务中的表现。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习赛道中的PDDL领域和任务子集，测试DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和LAMA规划器，包括标准PDDL和混淆PDDL两种场景。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL领域表现与LAMA竞争，所有LLM在混淆任务中性能下降但降幅小于之前模型，相比前代LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划任务上取得实质性进步，缩小了与传统规划器在挑战性基准上的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域中访问学习表示中的信息对于科学发现至关重要，需要一种能够解耦潜在子空间的方法来分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导，显式分离条件信息与残差表示，实现潜在子空间的解耦。

Result: 在合成2D高斯玩具问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文学数据集三个实验中，该方法能够访问高维数据的有意义特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示提供了一种简单而强大的机制，为使用生成模型进行科学探索开辟了途径。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实创意领域中从表面理解到可执行精度的能力差距。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令落地、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能显著下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成方面的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，突显了在真实创意领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过聚合多个生成模型来增强AI安全性的架构无关方法，通过共识采样算法选择最安全的模型子集来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全方法主要依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险仅通过检查无法检测，需要补充性的安全增强方法。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，给定k个模型和提示，实现与最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的风险水平，在模型间缺乏足够共识时弃权。算法利用模型计算输出概率的能力。

Result: 当足够多的模型安全且表现出充分一致时，可以限制弃权概率。算法能够将集合中未知安全模型子集的安全保证放大到单个可靠模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的模型无关AI安全方法，通过聚合多个模型来增强安全性，但需要安全模型间有一定重叠，且在所有模型都不安全时无法提供保护。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.
