### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training的新方法，通过在适配器训练期间为混淆因素提供快捷路径，防止适配器内部化这些因素，从而解决个性化图像生成中的属性纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的适配器训练方法在个性化图像生成中容易将目标属性（如身份）与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）纠缠在一起，限制了模型的泛化能力和文本提示的遵循能力。

Method: 在适配器训练期间，通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为混淆因素提供快捷路径，消除适配器内部化这些因素的动机，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 当寻求解耦表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应该学习的内容建立快捷路径，这为大型模型时代提供了一个通用的设计原则。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过将参考视频作为语义提示来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制，在开源方法中达到了新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: VAP 将问题重新定义为上下文生成，使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过即插即用的混合变换器专家来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，并采用时间偏置位置嵌入来消除虚假映射先验。

Result: VAP 在开源方法中达到新的最先进水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美，并构建了包含10万对视频的VAP-Data数据集。

Conclusion: VAP 的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配方法建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度，同时在可见点上保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的判别式模型在存在不确定性时只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态轨迹，特别是在视觉遮挡情况下。

Method: 采用生成式框架，结合流匹配公式、窗口相关先验用于跨窗口一致性，以及针对点坐标调整的方差调度，在推理时使用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现出色，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度，在可见点上与现有判别式跟踪器竞争力相当。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪性能，同时保持可见点跟踪的竞争力。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [4] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D接地推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这限制了模型输出与临床诊断工作流程的对齐，影响了临床医生与AI的可靠协作。

Method: 构建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本提供五元组：3D MRI体积、诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤和结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，为定位和诊断准确性提供基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的资源库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的局部决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

### [5] [Thermal Polarimetric Multi-view Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20972)
*Takahiro Kushida,Kenichiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法不依赖光照和材料属性，通过长波红外偏振成像解决可见光偏振分析中的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法依赖光照和材料属性，存在局限性。热偏振成像能够避免可见光偏振分析中的模糊性问题，为透明、半透明和异质物体的详细3D重建提供新途径。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，证明长波红外偏振成像不受可见光偏振模糊性影响。提出了基于多视角热偏振图像的3D形状恢复方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了独立于光照和材料属性的有效解决方案，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的透明和异质物体。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [6] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA提出了一种基于视频的无监督自适应方法，用于视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺场景下的领域适应，通过多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺领域性能下降的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而生成语言模型的自监督适应策略在视觉编码器模型中效果不佳。

Method: 基于自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA通过多视角物体观察有效学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可提升视觉基础模型在目标领域的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

### [7] [BioDet: Boosting Industrial Object Detection with Image Preprocessing Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21000)
*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化即插即用流水线，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流水线在工业环境中的复杂条件下（如杂乱、光照差、复杂背景）性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要更可靠的检测方法。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，结合低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的假阳性，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中对未见物体的2D检测具有有效性和实用性，能够显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [8] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于深度学习的混合框架，用于在地震后自动检测混凝土结构中暴露的钢筋，从而评估结构损伤程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要。暴露钢筋的数量和分布是结构损伤和退化的指标。

Method: 使用YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋，另一个YOLO模型区分不同结构损伤等级，结合数据增强和微调技术构建混合框架。

Result: 开发了能够自动可靠地从输入图像确定损伤等级的框架，在2023年土耳其地震数据集上验证有效。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤背景下实现快速自动化的损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

### [9] [ZING-3D: Zero-shot Incremental 3D Scene Graphs via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21069)
*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型进行开放词汇识别，生成丰富的语义场景表示，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视角设置，不支持增量更新，缺乏明确的3D空间几何接地，这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间，节点表示具有特征、3D位置和语义上下文的开放词汇对象，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需特定任务训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

### [10] [Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Model for Plexus Detection in Hirschsprung's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21083)
*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念和视觉语言模型的框架，用于指导Hirschsprung病结肠神经丛分类，相比传统CNN模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在结肠神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要将专家知识融入模型以提高临床相关性。

Method: 使用基于对比语言图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（通过大语言模型生成并经团队审核），用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 提出的模型在各项分类指标上优于CNN模型（VGG-19、ResNet-18、ResNet-50），准确率达到83.9%，精确率86.6%，特异性87.6%。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可以产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

### [11] [HistRetinex: Optimizing Retinex model in Histogram Domain for Efficient Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21100)
*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，实现快速低光照图像增强。该方法通过定义直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵，构建两级优化模型，显著提升了处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Retinex的低光照图像增强方法在大尺寸图像上耗时严重，需要一种更高效的增强方法。

Method: 1. 定义直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵；2. 基于先验信息和直方图Retinex模型构建两级优化模型；3. 通过求解优化模型得到光照和反射率直方图的迭代公式；4. 通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上均优于现有方法，在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: HistRetinex是一种高效的低光照图像增强方法，在保持增强质量的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

*Weijie Zhou,Xuantang Xiong,Yi Peng,Manli Tao,Chaoyang Zhao,Honghui Dong,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，要求智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察进行推理，并根据视觉反馈动态调整决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的视觉推理主要在静态、完全可观察的环境中进行研究，限制了其在现实世界部分可观察环境中的应用。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够主动获取和整合信息的智能体。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注，用于训练在高级马尔可夫决策过程中的智能体。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在主动视觉推理任务中实现最先进性能。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA, RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath, Geometry30K)任务中均达到最先进性能。分析显示当前具身MLLMs虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在通过交互主动获取和整合信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展方向，当前模型在主动推理能力方面存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体像人类一样主动探索和交互以获取信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

### [13] [SafetyPairs: Isolating Safety Critical Image Features with Counterfactual Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21120)
*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过图像编辑生成仅在安全相关特征上不同的反事实图像对，用于系统评估和训练图像安全检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标注粗糙模糊，无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征，难以系统区分良性图像和问题图像。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，只改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变。

Result: 构建了包含3,020个SafetyPair图像的基准数据集，涵盖9个安全类别，显著提高了轻量级防护模型的样本效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs框架为研究细粒度图像安全区分提供了首个系统资源，能有效评估视觉语言模型区分细微图像差异的能力。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NoisyGRPO框架，通过注入可控噪声到视觉输入来增强多模态大语言模型的强化学习训练，使用贝叶斯优势估计提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用思维链推理能力时难以泛化到训练分布之外，需要更好的探索和优势估计方法。

Method: 1) 噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中添加高斯噪声鼓励更广泛场景探索；2) 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推理问题，融合噪声水平和轨迹奖励信息。

Result: 在标准思维链质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提高了泛化性和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模MLLMs如Qwen2.5-VL 3B上。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的多模态强化学习框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，旨在减少对碘对比剂的依赖和相关风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTPA依赖碘对比剂，存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高风险患者中。研究旨在开发一种无需对比剂即可生成类似CTPA图像的方法。

Method: 使用基于Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN)的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA图像。研究使用了410对CTPA和NCCT扫描数据，分为训练集和测试集。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71, SSIM: 0.98；测试集MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27, SSIM: 0.98），在肺血管分割和血管量化任务中显著优于NCCT输入（Dice系数等指标明显提升），血管体积ICC值也显著改善（0.81 vs 0.70）。

Conclusion: 提出的DCCTPA方法能够有效增强血管显示，特别是在小血管方面，为减少对比剂使用提供了可行方案，在肺血管疾病诊断中具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于CLIP的零样本异常检测框架，通过动态对齐视觉和可学习文本空间实现细粒度异常学习，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐不同对象和领域视觉语义的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别的对齐阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 提出TokenCLIP框架，将视觉标记与定制化的文本子空间动态对齐，通过最优传输问题建模动态对齐过程，使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划并专门化不同视觉区域的子空间。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态标记级对齐机制，有效提升了零样本异常检测的性能，实现了更精细的异常语义学习。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估不准确，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演化(KBE)框架，整合多模态知识重构和扩展问题，实现难度可控的评估。

Result: 实验表明KBE能缓解数据污染和饱和风险，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法，解决了静态基准的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和创新的架构设计，在3D网格生成任务中实现了高效且高质量的结果，代码将在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Motivation: 3DGS虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，无法满足视觉语言导航的需求。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D方法，包含两个组件：(1)对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注；(2)物理感知执行连接，在3DGS中嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench（包含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但具有强泛化性，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Motivation: 由于输入分辨率受限，多模态大语言模型在理解高分辨率图像中的视觉细节和定位极小物体方面面临挑战，特别是在杂乱背景中的超小物体。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 全局语义探索(GSE)进行指令引导推理生成文本响应和粗略目标区域；2) 局部感知细化(LPR)细化区域生成精确边界框和分割掩码。引入定位感知的回顾奖励来优化GSE。

Conclusion: FineRS通过两阶段强化学习框架有效解决了高分辨率图像中极小物体的精确理解和定位问题，在推理和分割任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: VL-SAE是一种稀疏自编码器，通过将视觉-语言表示编码为隐藏激活来解读多模态对齐，每个神经元对应一个由语义相似的图像和文本表示的概念，从而用统一的概念集解释这些表示。


<details>

Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型具有强大的多模态推理能力，但其对齐组件的可解释性尚未得到研究，主要困难在于将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集中。

Method: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，使用基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定的解码器，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLMs（如CLIP、LLaVA）上的实验表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面具有优越能力，能够通过概念比较理解对齐，并在零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE成功地将视觉-语言表示映射到统一概念集，不仅提高了对齐的可解释性，还能通过概念级对齐增强多模态表示，为下游任务带来性能提升。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提高了复杂环境条件下的识别精度，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用注视数据进行训练的注视正则化框架，通过注视正则化注意力机制将模型焦点与人类视觉注视对齐，显著提升了第一人称视角理解任务中未来事件预测和当前活动理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类注视提供了关于注意力、短期意图和未来行动的有价值线索，是建模第一人称行为的强大信号。现有方法要么仅依赖视觉输入，要么将注视作为辅助输入信号，而本研究探索仅使用注视数据进行训练的方法。

Method: 提出注视正则化注意力机制，在训练期间使用注视数据来对齐模型焦点与人类视觉注视。该方法灵活且模块化，可泛化到多个使用注意力的VLM架构。

Result: 实验结果显示，与没有注视正则化的基线模型相比，该方法在未来事件预测中的语义预测分数提高了11分，在当前活动理解中提高了约7分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用人类注视增强VLM在现实场景（如辅助机器人和人机协作）中的预测能力奠定了基础，证明了注视引导训练在提高第一人称VLM准确性和鲁棒性方面的价值。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

Motivation: 当前生成式数据增强框架存在任务隔离问题，每个视觉任务需要独立训练生成模型，且忽略了地理信息和空间约束的建模。

Method: 提出地理空间布局编码器统一边界框和分割掩码输入，结合多尺度注入方案和掩码加权损失来显式编码从全局结构到细节的空间约束，并构建了首个大规模多任务遥感布局生成数据集。

Conclusion: TerraGen为遥感视觉任务提供了一个灵活、空间可控的统一生成框架，解决了任务隔离问题并有效建模了地理空间约束。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度一致性约束和多阶段对齐机制，结合高效的拼接缝处理策略，成功解决了大视差下的图像拼接问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高了算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Motivation: 针对长视频平台的视频检索需求，现有方法在处理未修剪视频和多模态查询方面存在局限，需要新的基准来推动该领域发展。

Method: 构建了MUVR基准，支持视频中心的多模态查询（长文本描述、视频标签提示、掩码提示），采用一对多检索范式，建立了基于核心视频内容的多层次视觉对应关系（复制、事件、场景、实例、动作等六个层次）。

Conclusion: MUVR基准为长视频平台的视频检索提供了实用的评估框架，揭示了现有方法的不足，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的框架，用于自适应识别图像相关概念轴并在真实世界场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念接地。该方法利用预训练的视觉语言模型和通用提示策略，无需先验知识即可识别多样化的图像相关轴，并通过组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语言接地的视觉概念学习方面仅限于少数预定义的基本轴（如颜色和形状），且通常在合成数据集中探索。人类智能能够轻松沿丰富的语义维度解释视觉场景，因此需要开发能够自适应识别多样化概念轴的方法。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别图像相关概念轴；开发通用概念编码器，自适应地将视觉特征绑定到发现的轴上，无需为每个概念引入额外模型参数；通过优化组合锚定目标来沿发现轴接地视觉概念。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ子集上展示了有效性，展示了在多样化真实世界概念上的卓越编辑能力，这些概念过于多样化而无法手动预定义。方法还表现出强大的组合泛化能力，优于现有的视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够自适应识别和接地视觉概念，无需手动预定义概念轴，在真实世界场景中展现出卓越的编辑能力和组合泛化性能，为语言接地的视觉概念学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，能够合成具有精细几何结构、准确关节连接和真实外观的人造3D物体。该方法通过变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜空间，并使用潜扩散模型进行多样化采样，结合关节感知的高斯解码器重建真实3D形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合成具有关节结构的3D物体时，难以同时保证几何一致性、关节准确性和外观真实性，特别是在处理关节依赖的可见性变化方面存在不足。

Method: 1. 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性（关节类型、轴、原点、范围和部件类别）嵌入统一潜空间；2. 在潜空间上训练潜扩散模型进行多样化采样；3. 引入关节感知高斯解码器，根据关节状态重建真实3D形状，处理关节依赖的可见性变化。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的家具类物体实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法，能够为通常被遮挡的区域分配合理的纹理特征。

Conclusion: ArtiLatent为关节3D物体的合成和操作提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，显著提高了跨关节配置的视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

Motivation: 语言和视觉语言模型在广泛任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚。本研究旨在理解文本生成模型中个体注意力头如何专门化处理特定语义或视觉属性。

Method: 基于现有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释使用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，从而以原则性方式分析多个样本，并根据注意力头与目标概念的相关性进行排序。

Result: 研究发现在单模态和多模态变换器中，注意力头层面存在一致的专门化模式。使用该方法选择并编辑仅1%的注意力头，就能可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。该方法在语言任务和视觉语言任务上均得到验证。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力层中存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出了两种各向异性池化方法：1）广义中值池化；2）学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种图像恢复基准测试中，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法的性能，为管理查找表大小和保持大感受野提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Motivation: 在线视频异常检测由于实时性和计算强度而很少受到关注，而离线VAD因大语言模型和视觉语言模型的进展而受到重视。本文旨在解决在线VAD的固有复杂性。

Method: MoniTor采用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合受LSTM启发的预测机制来捕获时间依赖性，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的评估表明，MoniTor优于最先进的方法，并且在无需训练的情况下与弱监督方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够有效建模时间依赖性并识别异常行为。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice是一个新颖的视频修复框架，通过解耦视频修复为两个子任务：多帧一致图像修复和掩码区域运动传播，引入间隔帧先验来指导修复过程，提升时空稳定性和内容控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分内容控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，通过拼接机制将初始帧内容扩散到后续参考帧；还设计了上下文控制器模块，在帧复制后编码连贯先验并将拼接视频注入I2V生成主干，有效约束生成过程中的内容失真。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多样化视频修复场景中实现了竞争性性能，显著改善了前景对齐和运动稳定性，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦策略和间隔帧先验有效解决了视频修复中的时空稳定性问题，为视频修复领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中准确性高但缺乏可解释性，临床医生需要透明、可验证的解释来信任自动化诊断并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个转码器集成，将医学图像表示分解为约5000个单语义模式，涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影等类别。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明医学AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器主要关注全局图像表示，但忽视了细粒度区域分析，由于缺乏细粒度标注数据和预训练范式，限制了细粒度感知能力。

Method: 构建了包含200万张图像和1.8亿个高质量区域级标注的Gran-29M数据集，开发了预训练-适配框架和自蒸馏机制，通过边界框到标题回归和标题到边界框回归增强局部视觉表示。

Result: GranViT超越了现有视觉编码器，在不同LLMs上表现出强迁移性，在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解方面取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: GranViT通过大规模细粒度预训练和区域级自回归训练，显著提升了视觉编码器的细粒度感知能力，在多模态任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，并引入了Foresight Guidance (FSG)方法，通过早期阶段解决长间隔子问题来提高扩散模型的效率和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择，需要一种统一的理论框架来理解和改进条件引导机制。

Method: 提出统一视角将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，寻找黄金路径使潜在变量在条件和无条件生成下产生一致输出。引入FSG方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并解锁了自适应设计的潜力，证明了FSG在理论和实践上的优越性。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法在流匹配文本到图像生成中存在两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时序动态特性。

Method: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，将连续步骤分组为捕捉流匹配内在时序动态的'块'，在块级别优化策略，并引入可选的加权采样策略进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面均取得优越结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专门为夜间无人机跟踪设计的多尺度自适应系统，通过三个核心模块解决夜间跟踪的主要技术挑战，在UAVDark135基准测试中性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有基于低光增强和域自适应的方法在实际无人机系统中存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态物体信息等问题。

Method: 提出MATrack系统，包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次融合(MHB)增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性；自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的物体信息；夜间模板校准器(NTC)确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提升5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。在实际无人机平台测试中验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架，明确将字形恢复与图像增强解耦：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用它们指导后续的全图像超分辨率。

Result: 在UltraZoom-ST数据集上的广泛实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时提高了可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过字形到图像的引导机制，打破了图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡，实现了高保真度和视觉一致性。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能显著提升显著目标检测的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑两种策略解决资源受限场景下模型过度自信和性能下降的问题，在检索任务中优于现有方法且训练数据需求减少100倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限环境下，现有跨模态对齐模型（如CLIP）因数据质量差或规模小而导致的过度自信和性能下降问题，特别是面对模糊或弱相关图像-文本对时的挑战。

Method: 提出Modest-Align框架，采用两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入可控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（在嵌入空间校准相似度分布），共同降低过度自信并提升对噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅需比CLIP少100倍以上的训练数据和600倍以下的GPU时间即可获得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: Modest-Align为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了模型在数据受限环境中的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频生成模型通过大型潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术取得了巨大进展，但仍然存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，破坏了真实3D场景的幻觉。3D一致的视频生成对生成和重建任务的下游应用具有重要影响。

Method: 通过基于偏好的优化使用成对极线几何约束来对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法高效地强制执行几何原理，无需端到端可微分性。在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练确保高质量测量，同时模型能有效泛化到各种动态内容。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，后者产生噪声目标从而损害对齐质量。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，在不影响视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Motivation: 解决点云数据在不同领域训练规模有限的问题，同时避免混合域预训练知识可能与下游任务不对齐导致的性能下降。

Method: 设计异构域适配器（包含预训练阶段的适应模式和微调阶段的融合模式）和域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效整合跨域点云数据知识，提升点云分析任务的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过模拟学生模型的学习进程动态调整知识蒸馏，显著提升了知识传递效果

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human

*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了长尾识别方法在NACTI野生动物数据集上的应用，通过实验优化LTR损失函数和正则化方法，显著提升了物种识别准确率，并在域偏移测试中展示了更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NACTI数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大的'Head'类别占数据集的50%以上。为了解决长尾分布对物种识别性能的影响，需要系统研究长尾识别方法。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究长尾识别方法，包括各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感的正则化技术，并在NACTI数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，显著优于使用标准交叉熵的95.51%基线。在域偏移测试中，优化后的长尾增强模型在ENA-Detection数据集上达到52.55%的准确率。

Conclusion: LTR增强的调度器选择与先进LTR损失函数结合能带来一致改进，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决某些问题，包括在严重域偏移下对'Tail'类别的灾难性失效。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统突触分类需要监督学习，但该方法旨在仅基于相邻突触相似性进行无监督分类，无需先验知识。

Method: 利用同一神经元内相邻突触比随机突触更相似的原理，开发无监督分类算法，应用于果蝇数据。

Result: 成功实现了突触的无监督分类，无需预先指定类型数量。

Conclusion: 该方法为突触分类提供了原则性的无监督途径，可能有助于选择覆盖突触结构范围的真实标注。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器在皮肤病理学全玻片图像分类中的性能，发现Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现优于UNI，逻辑回归达到90%的最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，本研究旨在评估基础模型在WSI分类中的性能。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取斑块级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略聚合成玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归对Virchow2达到90%的最高准确率，但差异无统计学意义。均值聚合方法提供了可靠的玻片级特征表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动WSI分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为玻片级表示学习的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个用于无限扩展3D场景合成的分层框架，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验来解决现有方法在几何一致性、可扩展性和场景级生成方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在跨视图的几何和外观不一致性，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型大多面向对象而非场景级生成。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：(1)高质量场景块数据整理流程，使3D结构化潜在表示适用于场景生成；(2)3D块修复机制，实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略，确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在大型3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了WorldGrow构建大规模虚拟环境的能力以及在构建未来世界模型方面的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

TL;DR: BachVid是一种无需训练的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，在去噪过程中提取前景掩码和匹配点，通过缓存身份视频的中间变量并注入到新生成的视频中，实现多视频间前景和背景的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到视频生成中多个视频之间角色和背景一致性的挑战，现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只关注角色一致性。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明BachVid在生成的视频中实现了稳健的一致性，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖且高效的解决方案，用于无需参考图像或额外训练的一致性视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

TL;DR: 视觉扩散模型可作为几何求解器，通过像素空间直接解决几何问题，包括内接正方形问题、斯坦纳树问题和简单多边形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型在解决长期存在的几何问题上的能力，建立生成建模与几何问题求解之间的桥梁。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型将高斯噪声转换为表示有效近似解的图像，将几何推理重新构造为图像生成。

Result: 模型成功学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置，在三个著名几何问题上获得接近精确解的近似解。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作为解决困难几何问题提供了一个通用实用框架，为处理更广泛几何任务打开了大门。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多高风险AI应用需要形成数据驱动的假设并进行有针对性的猜测，但现有语言模型在理性信息寻求方面存在不足，需要开发方法进行基准测试和增强。

Method: 引入协作战舰战略对话任务，开发基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，分别针对信息提供者和信息寻求者角色进行优化。

Result: 该方法使信息提供者准确率提升14.7%，信息寻求者预期信息增益提升0.227比特，组合使用使F1分数提升0.303-0.374，弱模型Llama-4-Scout胜率从8%提升至82%。

Conclusion: 基于贝叶斯实验设计的推理策略能显著提升语言模型在信息寻求任务中的理性决策能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少样本上下文学习，使标准指令语言模型无需微调即可实现与强化学习训练推理模型相当甚至更优的推理能力，同时在多个任务上表现更好且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行成本高且缓慢。研究发现标准指令语言模型本身已具备强大推理潜力，只需合适方法激发。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，结合CodeAct框架（语言模型交替进行自然语言推理和代码执行）和少样本引导上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现。

Result: 在四个匹配的语言模型和推理模型对中，CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均表现优于对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提高10-81%；在四个模型平均上，六个任务表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础良好且强大的系统，为权重内强化学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 随着语言模型处理长篇复杂文本能力的增强，其在计算文学研究中的应用日益增多。然而，由于长文本细粒度标注成本高昂以及使用公共领域文学存在数据污染问题，评估这些模型在此类任务中的实用性仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 构建并发布FICSIM数据集，包含长篇现代小说，标注了12个相似性维度，这些标注基于作者提供的元数据并经数字人文学者验证。评估了一系列嵌入模型在该任务上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，当前嵌入模型普遍倾向于关注表面特征，而不是对计算文学研究任务有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集为评估语言模型在文学领域的表现提供了基准，揭示了当前模型在理解文学文本深层语义方面的局限性。研究过程中优先考虑作者权益，依赖持续、知情的作者同意。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

Motivation: 现有评估大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法代表真实世界文档理解的复杂性，需要开发能捕捉现实高风险任务的长上下文基准。

Method: 使用236个案例对的数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型从美国最高法院案例中识别推翻关系的能力。

Result: 模型在历史案例上表现较差，依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解，在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个解决现实长上下文评估关键差距的基准，反映了实际法律推理任务的复杂性和重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但会增加token使用量，且在某些任务中可能无效甚至有害。需要一种智能机制来决定何时使用思维链推理。

Method: 提出置信度门控思维链方法，评估四种训练免费的置信度估计方法，与随机基线和理想情况对比，通过实验分析不同置信度度量在不同数据集和模型上的表现。

Result: 现有训练免费的置信度度量可以减少冗余思维链使用，优于随机调用思维链，但不同置信度度量的效用不一致，受数据集和模型影响。

Conclusion: 置信度门控思维链具有潜力但存在局限性，当前方法在实际部署中仍有困难，需要进一步研究更可靠的自适应门控机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DR-IKE框架，通过动态检索和选择编辑演示来解决知识编辑中的数量-质量权衡和任务难度适应性问题，无需修改模型权重即可在COUNTERFACT基准上显著提升编辑成功率并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于上下文的知识编辑方法依赖静态演示集选择的问题，这些方法存在数量-质量权衡和缺乏对任务难度适应性的缺陷。

Method: 训练BERT检索器使用REINFORCE算法根据编辑奖励对演示进行排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例，在编辑容易时缩短提示，任务困难时扩展提示。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准上，编辑成功率提高达17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持对不相关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，仅依赖前向传播，与黑盒LLMs兼容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语问答，通过问题复杂度分类器选择回答策略，使用机器翻译进行数据增强，但多检索策略存在不一致性影响整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，本研究旨在解决语言差距问题，将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语这一低资源语言。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，包含问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略；使用机器翻译作为数据增强方法来解决印尼语数据集有限的问题。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了低资源语言问答的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个公开的中文药物推荐数据集CDrugRed，专注于代谢疾病出院药物推荐，包含5,894条去标识化记录，并评估了多个LLM模型在该任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能药物推荐系统发展中公开真实世界EHR数据集稀缺的问题，特别是非英语语言的数据集匮乏。

Method: 构建包含患者人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等全面信息的CDrugRed数据集，并对多个最先进的大型语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 监督微调能提高模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1得分为0.5648，Jaccard得分为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更稳健准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

*Qingru Zhang,Liang Qiu,Ilgee Hong,Zhenghao Xu,Tianyi Liu,Shiyang Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Zheng Li,Lihong Li,Bing Yin,Chao Zhang,Jianshu Chen,Haoming Jiang,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，解决了SFT在有限数据场景下的过拟合和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)作为离线策略方法，在有限数据场景下容易过拟合且泛化能力差，需要一种能够提升泛化性能的在线策略微调方法。

Method: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，核心是设计奖励函数作为SFT模型与预训练基础模型的对数策略比率，将预训练策略作为基线，SFT策略作为目标，结合PPO实现在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的场景下。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO通过自奖励机制与PPO的结合，有效解决了SFT的局限性，提升了泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性，为使用演示数据对齐大语言模型提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了VeriGray基准测试，通过引入Out-Dependent类别来解决摘要忠实性评估中的标注模糊问题，发现即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有忠实性基准测试存在标注模糊问题，主要由于对生成输出中允许的外部知识边界定义不清，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实性标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准测试。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准测试对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊性对不忠实检测基准测试至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

TL;DR: 本调查首次从编排角度系统回顾了LLM与文本属性图(TAG)的集成，提出了新的分类法，涵盖LLM增强图任务和图结构改进LLM推理两个方向，并讨论了编排策略、TAG特定技术、实证见解和应用领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在语义理解和生成方面表现出色但缺乏结构化推理能力，而文本属性图(TAG)提供显式关系结构但语义深度不足。两者的结合可以产生互补优势：增强TAG表示学习并提高LLM的推理能力和可解释性。

Method: 提出新的分类法，包括两个基本方向：LLM for TAG（LLM丰富基于图的任务）和TAG for LLM（结构化图改进LLM推理）。将编排策略分类为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论TAG特定预训练、提示和参数高效微调的进展。

Result: 总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并突出了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等领域的多样化应用。

Conclusion: 在语言和图学习的交叉领域，LLM与TAG的集成具有巨大潜力，但仍面临开放挑战，需要进一步研究来充分发挥两者的协同效应。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLMs在社交模拟中的行为偏差，发现LLMs无法忠实再现真实人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极偏见，形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性的"乌托邦"社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在模拟人类行为方面显示出潜力，但在社交情境中与真实人类行为的差异程度尚未充分探索，这可能在科学研究中导致误解，在实际应用中产生意外后果。

Method: 引入系统框架分析LLMs在社交模拟中的行为，通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，提供简单有效的方法来检验涌现的社会认知偏见。

Result: 对三个家族八个代表性LLMs进行广泛实验，发现LLMs表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极偏见，形成"乌托邦"社会，缺乏真实人类互动的复杂性和变异性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发更具社会基础性的LLMs，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Motivation: 爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试资源有限，缺乏对不同LLM在爱沙尼亚语任务上性能的全面比较评估。

Method: 基于7个从本土爱沙尼亚语源生成的数据集构建新基准，评估基础模型、开源指令调优模型和商业模型，采用人工评估和LLM作为评判者两种评估方法。

Result: 人工评估得分与基准评估呈现中等到高度相关性，Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为LLM评判者与人类评分高度一致。

Conclusion: 顶级LLM能够有效支持爱沙尼亚语模型的评估工作，为爱沙尼亚语LLM发展提供了重要基准工具。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and
computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

*Xin Du,Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用相关维度（一种分形几何度量）来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，以解决传统评估指标忽略长程结构复杂性的问题。该方法能够揭示预训练的三个不同阶段、反映上下文依赖的复杂性、指示模型幻觉倾向，并可靠检测生成文本的多种退化形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言生成方面取得了显著进展，但即使困惑度较低时仍表现出令人困惑的行为（如重复和不连贯）。这凸显了传统评估指标的局限性，它们强调局部预测准确性而忽略了长程结构复杂性。

Method: 引入相关维度（一种分形几何的自相似性度量）来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性。该方法捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中桥接局部和全局属性。

Result: 通过广泛实验表明，相关维度能够：(1) 揭示预训练中的三个不同阶段；(2) 反映上下文依赖的复杂性；(3) 指示模型的幻觉倾向；(4) 可靠检测生成文本的多种退化形式。该方法计算效率高，对模型量化（低至4位精度）具有鲁棒性，广泛适用于自回归架构。

Conclusion: 相关维度为LLMs的生成动态提供了新的见解，是一种计算高效、鲁棒且广泛适用的文本复杂性评估方法，能够更好地捕捉语言的长程结构特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)的即插即用方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来增加块级稀疏性，提高LLM预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要源于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，特别是对于长序列，这提供了优化机会。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，通过序列的置换来增加块级稀疏性，并开发了自定义的permuted-FlashAttention内核。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确性上持续优于现有的块稀疏注意力方法，并接近完整注意力基线。在长上下文预填充中实现了高达2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种实用可行的注意力优化方法，能够有效提高长上下文处理的计算效率。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过在解码过程中注入语义相似性惩罚来减少语义冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中，准确估计大语言模型的语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，通常需要大量昂贵的生成过程。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，涵盖自回归和掩码扩散范式，并通过重要性重加权和控制变量减少不确定性估计的偏差和方差。

Result: 在四个问答基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下匹配或超越基线方法，覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该框架作为模块化增强工具，无需访问基础LLM的梯度，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了英语语言处理模型在字符内部顺序被打乱（typoglycemia）时的鲁棒性，发现这种鲁棒性主要源于两个因素：少数英语单词在这种变形下会重叠，且重叠单词的上下文差异足够大，使得消歧变得简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解为什么NLP模型能够在字符内部顺序被打乱的情况下仍能良好工作，特别是当许多不同单词（如form和from）在typoglycemia下会变成相同表示时，模型如何解决这种歧义问题。

Method: 研究方法包括：(i) 分析英国国家语料库以量化typoglycemia下的单词重叠和歧义程度；(ii) 评估BERT模型消歧重叠形式的能力；(iii) 通过比较在干净文本和typoglycemia文本上从头训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 研究结果显示，字符打乱导致的性能下降比预期要小，表明模型对这种变形具有较好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结论是英语NLP模型对typoglycemia的鲁棒性主要归因于单词重叠现象相对较少，且重叠单词的上下文差异足够明显，使得模型能够轻松进行消歧。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在真实旅行中断情况下修改行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重程度和旅行者容忍度等维度，评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但无法有效应对现实旅行中的各种中断情况，需要评估LLM在动态变化环境中的适应能力。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1）引入自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2）使用LLM作为评判者自动评估修订质量；3）进行人工专家评估验证语义、空间、顺序和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: 实验显示LLM在顺序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但在长途旅行中减少，但中断处理能力随计划长度增加而下降，表明LLM鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前LLM在应对复杂中断时的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，对于推理任务，单轮训练比多轮训练更有效。单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都能良好泛化，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，但实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。本研究探讨多轮训练是否对推理任务必要。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮设置下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都能有效泛化，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。多轮训练仅提供有限益处，甚至可能损害推理能力。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练基本反馈带来的益处有限且可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

*Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手动编写问答基准数据集，用于测试多语言模型在瑞典特定知识上的表现。研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多瑞典基准测试是翻译自美国为中心的基准，不适合测试与瑞典特别相关或特定于瑞典的知识。因此需要创建专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准。

Method: 手动编写针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准数据集，标注者从瑞典文化和媒体公众人物的流行广播节目以及主要体育赛事中获取灵感。数据集包含英文翻译，可用于测试不同规模和瑞典覆盖度的模型的事实回忆能力。

Result: 研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集具有作为诊断工具的潜力，可用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留，以及在语言适应过程中的表现。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的大规模土耳其语编码器模型，在多个NLP任务中表现与现有模型相当，但发现缩放优势有限，强调语料质量比数据量更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大型预训练模型中的代表性不足问题，特别是为土耳其语提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 从零开始训练基于RoBERTa的编码器模型，使用312GB土耳其语文本数据（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科），发布基础和大型两种配置。

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现与现有土耳其语和多语言模型相当，大型变体在4个任务中的2个表现最佳，但整体没有一致的缩放优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT为土耳其语NLP提供了开源资源，同时作为实证案例研究显示在形态丰富语言中，语料组成比单纯数据规模更重要，当前基准可能已饱和。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种描述性字幕数据集和综合评估方法，用于评估视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中的表现，发现其性能与传统深度学习方法相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，视觉语言模型在医疗保健应用中展现出潜力，但在人类活动识别领域应用较少，且缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 引入描述性字幕数据集，提出综合评估方法，并与最先进的深度学习模型进行对比实验。

Result: 视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中达到与传统方法相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超越传统方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准和新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标来解决传统IR指标在RAG系统中的不适用问题，通过考虑LLM处理文档的方式和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提高了与最终答案准确性的相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序浏览文档的假设，但在RAG系统中，LLM会整体处理所有检索文档，且干扰文档会主动降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，提出UDCG指标，使用LLM导向的位置折扣来直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提高了最高36%

Conclusion: UDCG为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备的普及，远程患者监测需求增加，但现有研究在人机交互方面存在明显不足，需要更智能的交互系统来改善医疗保健服务。

Method: 系统整合多模态大语言模型、物联网和可穿戴设备，自动收集生命体征、加速度计和视频数据，使用异常检测模块（包括跌倒检测模型）识别紧急情况，并通过自然语言处理组件分析患者活动和情绪。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多奖励优化方法（MRO），通过增强扩散语言模型中的标记相关性来提高推理性能，同时实现采样加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上落后于自回归语言模型，主要原因是去噪过程中标记的独立生成未能捕捉标记相关性。

Method: 提出MRO方法，利用测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来直接优化标记相关性，并引入组步长和重要性采样策略来减少奖励方差和提高采样效率。

Result: 实验表明MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准高表现的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 通过增强标记相关性，扩散语言模型可以在减少去噪步骤的同时保持甚至提升推理性能，为扩散模型在推理任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在估计和改进语言模型与大脑对齐时存在参与者依赖性，且受限于每个参与者的数据量，这阻碍了对新参与者的泛化和群体层面的分析。

Method: 采用多参与者脑调优方法，微调预训练的语言模型来联合预测多个参与者的fMRI响应，实现跨参与者的泛化。

Result: 该方法使预测新参与者脑数据所需的fMRI数据量减少5倍，整体脑对齐提高达50%，并在新的未见数据集上表现出强泛化能力。同时，多参与者脑调优还提高了语义任务的下游性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了神经科学和AI之间的双向益处，有助于弥合两个领域之间的差距，多参与者脑调优产生了更可泛化的语义表示。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

Conclusion: 范畴论为文档结构分析提供了强大的数学框架，所开发的方法在信息提取、摘要生成和模型改进方面具有实际应用价值，并可扩展到多模态场景。

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在跨语言行为中对语言谱系结构的敏感性，发现模型在语言切换时倾向于选择谱系相关的语言，且知识一致性在谱系内部比跨谱系更好，但这些效应受训练数据资源可用性的强烈影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在跨语言行为中存在显著差异，但语言谱系结构在这种差异中的作用尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究LLMs是否对语言谱系表现出敏感性。

Method: 通过扩展对MultiQ数据集的先前分析，首先检查当提示语言保真度未保持时，模型是否倾向于切换到谱系相关的语言；然后调查知识一致性在谱系内部是否比跨谱系更好。

Result: 研究发现谱系水平效应存在，但受到训练资源可用性的强烈影响。不同LLMs家族表现出不同的跨语言策略。

Conclusion: LLMs编码了谱系水平结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其跨语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，需要更具挑战性的评估来超越表层语言能力，关注语用学——理解情境意义、语境以及语言和文化规范。

Method: 创建了斯洛文尼亚语的语用理解基准测试，包含405个多选题；讨论了翻译困难，建立了人类基线，并进行了大语言模型的试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达（特别是文化特定表达）的隐含意义时仍可能失败；发现专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准测试必须精心设计，最好基于本地数据构建，并通过人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位配列特征，应用无监督异常检测算法识别潜在的转录错误和借词。

Result: 虽然精度和召回率因异常性质微妙而保持适中，但音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法。

Conclusion: 高召回率方法为田野工作者提供了系统化标记需要验证条目的工具，支持低资源语言文档的数据质量改进。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务上表现出色，但在金融领域的股票预测任务中应用不足。研究发现现有模型过度依赖分析师观点，缺乏系统性的独立分析逻辑，且未能有效权衡对立证据。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动优化。该方法鼓励模型从多样化信息源动态构建分析框架，基于框架而非上下文观点来组织和评分涨跌证据，最后通过反思得出预测。

Result: 构建了大规模数据集，涵盖2024年全年5123只A股股票，包含长上下文和超过20万个样本。实验表明RETuning成功解锁了模型在金融领域的推理能力，即使在6个月后或分布外股票上仍有效。

Conclusion: RETuning方法使模型获得关于股票预测的宝贵洞察，确保独立逻辑推理并减少上下文的不当影响，显著提升了模型在金融任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出信息流追踪(IF-Track)方法，使用大语言模型作为概率编码器来量化推理过程中每一步的信息熵和增益，首次在单一度量空间中统一建模人类推理行为的普遍特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解信息在人类推理中如何动态积累和转化一直是认知心理学、哲学和人工智能领域的长期挑战。现有方法从经典逻辑到概率模型，虽然揭示了输出或个体建模的某些方面，但未能提供统一、定量的人类推理动态描述。

Method: 引入信息流追踪(IF-Track)方法，使用大语言模型作为概率编码器，在推理过程的每一步量化信息熵和增益。通过跨多个任务的细粒度分析，在单一度量空间中建模人类推理行为。

Result: IF-Track成功捕捉了基本推理特征，识别了系统性错误模式，并表征了个体差异。该方法在高级心理学理论讨论中，首次在IF-Track框架下调和了单过程与双过程理论，发现了人工与人类认知的对齐，以及LLMs如何重塑人类推理过程。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论与测量之间建立了定量桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性洞察，为理解人类推理动态提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模糊数表示方法——外延模糊数，以解决传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂性和结果特征不一致问题，并定义了相应的运算和关系操作符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在计算复杂度高、运算结果特征不一致（如两个三角模糊数相乘结果不是三角模糊数）以及模糊扩散等问题，限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数作为新的模糊数表示方法，定义了外延模糊数的运算规则和关系操作符（=, >, >=, <, <=），并通过C++实现验证。

Result: 提出的外延模糊数方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算中的问题，并通过应用实例展示了其可行性。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数提供了一种更有效的模糊数表示和运算方法，能够克服传统方法的局限性，扩展了模糊数的应用领域。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了何时应该优先采用AI输出而非人类专家判断的问题，提出了AI作为人工认知权威的概念，并批判了AI优先主义，主张采用全证据视角的AI依赖方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于解决AI系统与人类专家判断之间的权威冲突，探讨在什么条件下AI输出应该被优先考虑，以及如何避免对AI的盲目依赖。

Method: 方法包括引入人工认知权威概念，分析AI优先主义的缺陷，并发展全证据视角的AI依赖理论，强调AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代人类独立认知。

Result: 结果表明全证据视角具有三个关键优势：防止专业知识萎缩、为有意义的人类监督提供认知依据、解释在可靠性条件未满足时对AI的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 结论是虽然实践上要求较高，但全证据视角提供了一种原则性方法来确定何时AI依赖是合理的，特别是在需要严格可靠性的高风险情境中。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确翻译为空间SQL查询，通过知识库、语义增强和协作式多智能体管道解决空间查询的复杂性，在KaggleDBQA和SpatialQueryQA基准测试中分别达到81.2%和87.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SQL和PostGIS等地理空间工具的复杂性对非专家用户造成的障碍，克服单智能体方法在处理空间查询语义和语法复杂性时的困难。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括知识库（程序化模式分析和语义增强）、上下文检索嵌入、协作式多智能体管道（实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成）以及执行程序化和语义验证的审查智能体。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的准确率（272个问题中的221个），在空间查询中达到87.7%的准确率（90个问题中的79个），相比没有审查智能体的76.7%有明显提升。系统生成的查询在某些情况下比基准测试中的查询更符合用户意图。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更加易于访问，为空间文本到SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个针对医学视觉问答的新型框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在临床部署中的幻觉、推理效率和多机构协作问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在智能医疗领域具有巨大潜力，但面临三个关键挑战：产生基于视觉证据的幻觉答案、固定深度推理的低效性以及多机构协作的困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化目标，设计检索感知专家混合架构，采用联邦治理机制进行局部元认知不确定性估计和迭代链式思维推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上的实验表明，MedAlign实现了最先进的性能，比强检索增强基线在F1分数上提高了11.85%，同时与固定深度CoT方法相比平均推理长度减少了51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，为临床服务部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过分析LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化来生成对抗性外部知识，以毒化检索增强生成系统，在保持流畅性的同时实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法主要关注检索内容或提示结构的迭代操作，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突问题。

Method: 首先识别与上下文毒化知识强相关的毒化响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察到的归因信号重用有潜力但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法能持续实现超过90%的群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性，并有效解决知识冲突问题。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning框架通过神经元归因指导的毒化能有效解决知识冲突，实现大规模生成有效的毒化RAG知识，揭示了RAG毒化的潜在机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化框架，通过进化图优化方法为LLMs设计更好的提示和推理过程，在公共卫生、交通和行为任务中显著提升性能，并提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，为特定领域任务设计最优提示和推理过程是必要且具有挑战性的。如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合提示是尚未解决的关键问题。

Method: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，从专家构建的初始语义因果图(SCG)出发，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程生成确定性推理指导，并优化LLM以有效利用这些指导。采用迭代优化算法使用真实标签的文本梯度来精炼SCG和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中，EGO-Prompt相比最先进方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，使小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出精炼的领域特定SCG。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt成功解决了领域特定任务中提示设计和推理优化的挑战，显著提升了LLMs的性能和效率，同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来改善概率指令跟随(PIF)性能，提高回答多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务中表现出色，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务中表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: SSoT提示方法：首先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的回答多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能显著改善LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的表现，同时增强回答多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布漂移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应环境变化同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已有知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架不仅有效保护零样本迁移能力，还在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient

inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business

process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and

Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励的游戏中使用固定探索常数会导致性能问题，需要开发对奖励尺度不敏感的自适应λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中已有的λ选择策略，并提出了五种新策略，包括使用搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差来设置λ（λ=2σ）。

Result: 实验结果表明，新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务中优于现有λ选择策略，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用新提出的λ=2σ策略作为UCT算法的自适应探索常数选择方法，该方法对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Method: 提出Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，通过分析模型推理轨迹发现Self-Jailbreak现象，然后重新组合或回溯不安全的推理步骤，将模型引导回安全轨迹，同时保留有效的推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架通过系统性地处理推理过程中的不安全步骤，成功解决了大型推理模型的安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题，为构建更安全的推理模型提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

*Siddharth Mehrotra,Jin Huang,Xuelong Fu,Roel Dobbe,Clara I. Sánchez,Maarten de Rijke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文的综述分析发现，当前可信AI研究过度关注技术属性而忽视社会技术维度，需要采用结合技术严谨性与社会文化考量的跨学科方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI伦理研究主要采用技术中心方法，关注可靠性、鲁棒性和公平性等技术属性，但忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度如何在不同研究领域中被定义、操作化和应用，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 虽然在定义透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性方面取得显著进展，但研究发现存在关键差距。当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质仍较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的有争议概念。

Conclusion: 结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法对于推进可信AI至关重要。建议AI伦理社区采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架，促进惠及所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过在代码生成过程中加入符号验证和交互验证，提高动态或部分可观测环境中的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大语言模型的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境接地不足的问题，导致任务成功率较低。

Method: 在验证阶段生成探索性代码，主动与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态，结合符号验证和交互验证过程。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中，任务成功率比代码即策略基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强生成代码的接地性，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CXRAgent是一个基于LLM的导演编排多阶段智能体，用于胸部X光片分析，通过工具协调、多阶段推理和专家团队协作来提升诊断的适应性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新的诊断任务和复杂推理场景，且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制，限制了其适应性和可信度。

Method: 采用导演编排的三阶段架构：工具调用（包含证据驱动验证器）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（结合上下文记忆生成证据支持的结论）。

Result: 在各种CXR解释任务上的实验表明，CXRAgent表现出色，能提供视觉证据并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、可靠性和诊断能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan框架通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，解决了LLM在创意生成中倾向于高概率熟悉概念的问题，显著提升了科学想法的创新性和合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成创新想法时往往局限于训练数据中的高概率概念，而现有的搜索方法如思维树依赖不可靠的自我评估启发式方法，存在根本性限制。

Method: Magellan框架将创意生成重新定义为对LLM潜在概念空间的原则性引导探索，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，包括用于远程方向的语义罗盘向量和用于局部决策的景观感知价值函数。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Magellan在生成科学想法方面显著优于包括ReAct和ToT在内的强基线方法，在合理性和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 对于创意发现，原则性的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，这为LLM成为创新中更有能力的合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

*Ankur Sinha,Shobhit Arora,Dhaval Pujara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，配套开发了AutoOpt框架，通过深度学习模型自动识别数学表达式、生成PYOMO脚本并求解优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工干预和专业知识的问题，开发一个能够自动从图像中识别并求解优化问题的端到端框架。

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER模型在BLEU分数上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt-11k数据集和AutoOpt框架为自动化求解优化问题提供了有效工具，在数学表达式识别和复杂问题求解方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体长时推理中验证不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的长时推理失败往往不是因为生成能力弱，而是由于中间推理验证不足。需要将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程。

Method: 采用两种互补机制：冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实。CAMV将验证重新定义为冲突识别和针对性证伪，TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%的准确率，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到35.5%，在Chinese-SimpleQA上达到93.8%，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为基于LLM的智能体提供了一种可扩展的可靠长时推理范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用推动了这些改进。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模仿学习（ICL）的方法来训练神经控制屏障函数（CBF），用于在故障状态集难以正式指定的情况下保证自主系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全性是基本要求。传统基于优化的CBF合成方法计算成本高，且故障状态集往往难以正式指定，而专家演示数据更容易获取。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后利用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，表明该方法优于现有基线方法，且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为在故障状态集难以正式指定的情况下学习神经CBF提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够利用专家演示数据实现安全控制。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [113] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需对目标本体或实体数量设置限制。该方法在三个生物医学任务中表现优异，在类选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数最低达到63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全语境化到特定领域。虽然简单的成对本体匹配技术已经很成熟，但简单的等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成。复杂多本体匹配能够将一个源实体与多个目标实体的复合逻辑表达式对齐，建立更细致的等价关系和本体层次结构上的溯源。

Method: CMOMgen采用检索增强生成方法，选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。这是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，不限制目标本体或实体的数量。

Result: 在三个具有部分参考对齐的生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线方法。策略在两个任务中F1分数超过所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二，最低F1分数达到63%。对非参考映射的手动评估显示，46%的映射获得了最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，在复杂多本体匹配任务中表现出色，证明了专用策略的有效性。该方法为知识图谱构建中的本体集成提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态基准数据集，专门用于分析能源公司公关广告中的框架类型，特别是检测"漂绿"现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业经常在公关活动中存在言行不一的问题，比如石油天然气公司被指控通过气候友好倡议的影像进行"漂绿"。理解大规模框架及其变化有助于更好地理解公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建了一个专家标注的视频广告数据集，包含来自Facebook和YouTube的广告，涵盖13种框架类型、50多家公司或倡导团体、20个国家，专门用于视觉语言模型的评估。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息，F1分数达79%，而最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。研究还识别了视觉语言模型面临的挑战，如隐含框架、处理不同长度视频和隐含文化背景。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源部门战略沟通的多模态分析研究，为未来工作提供了改进空间。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.
